        <p>Stephanie Danler Sweetbitter For my grandparents Margaret Barton Ferrero and James Vercelli Ferrero Eros once again limb-loosener whirls me Sweetbitter, impossible to fight off, creature stealing up. — Sappho, translated by Anne Carson, Eros the Bittersweet “Let us now cast a philosophical glance at the pleasure or pain of which taste may be the occasion.” — Brillat-Savarin, translated by Anne Drayton, The Physiology of Taste</p>
<h2 id="Summer-I-You-Will-Develop-A-Palate"><a href="#Summer-I-You-Will-Develop-A-Palate" class="headerlink" title="Summer I You Will Develop A Palate."></a>Summer I You Will Develop A Palate.</h2><p>A palate is a spot on your tongue where you remember. Where you assign words to the textures of taste. Eating becomes a discipline, language-obsessed. You will never simply eat food again.</p>
<p>I DON’T KNOW what it is exactly, being a server. It’s a job, certainly, but not exclusively. There’s a transparency to it, an occupation stripped of the usual ambitions. One doesn’t move up or down. One waits. You are a waiter.</p>
<p>It is fast money - loose, slippery bills that inflate and disappear over the course of an evening. It can be a means, to those with concrete ends and unwavering vision. I grasped most of that easily enough when I was hired at the restaurant at twenty-two. Some of it was a draw: the money, the sense of safety that came from having a place to wait. What I didn’t see was that the time had severe brackets around it. Within those brackets nothing else existed. Outside of them, all you could remember was the blur of a momentary madness. Ninety percent of us wouldn’t even put it on a résumé. We might mention it as a tossed-off reference to our moral rigor, a badge of a certain kind of misery, like enduring earthquakes, or spending time in the army. It was so finite.</p>
<p>I CAME HERE in a car like everybody else. In a car filled with shit I thought meant something and shortly thereafter tossed on the street: DVDs, soon to be irrelevant, a box of digital and film cameras for a still-latent photography talent, a copy of On the Road that I couldn’t finish, and a Swedish-modern lamp from Walmart. It was a long, dark drive from a place so small you couldn’t find it on a generous map. Does anyone come to New York clean? I’m afraid not. But crossing the Hudson I thought of crossing Lethe, milky river of forgetting. I forgot that I had a mother who drove away before I could open my eyes, and a father who moved invisibly through the rooms of our house. I forgot the parade of people in my life as thin as mesh screens, who couldn’t catch whatever it was I wanted to say to them, and I forgot how I drove down dirt roads between desiccated fields, under an oppressive guard of stars, and felt nothing. Yes, I’d come to escape, but from what? The twin pillars of football and church? The low, faded homes on childless cul-de-sacs?</p>
<p>Mornings of the <em>Gazette</em> and boxed doughnuts? The sedated, sentimental middle of it? It didn’t matter. I would never know exactly, for my life, like most, moved only imperceptibly and definitively forward. Let’s say I was born in late June of 2006 when I came over the George Washington Bridge at seven a.m. with the sun circulating and dawning, the sky full of sharp corners of light, before the exhaust rose, before the heat gridlocked in, windows unrolled, radio turned up to some impossibly hopeful pop song, open, open, open. - SOUR: all the puckering citrus juices, the thin-skinned Meyer lemons, knobbed Kaffirs. Astringent yogurts and vinegars. Lemons resting in pint containers at all the cooks’ sides. Chef yelled, This needs acid! and they eviscerated lemons, leaving the caressing sting of food that’s alive. - I DIDN’T KNOW about the tollbooths. “I didn’t know,” I said to the tollbooth lady. “Can’t I squeeze through this one time?” The woman in the booth was as unmoved as an obelisk. The driver in the car behind me started honking, and then the driver behind him, until I wanted to duck under the steering wheel. She directed me to the side where I reversed, turned, and found myself facing the direction from which I had just come. I pulled off into a maze of industrial streets, each one more misleading than the next. It was irrational but I was terrified of not being able to find an ATM and having to go all the way back. I pulled into a Dunkin’ Donuts. I took out twenty dollars and looked at my remaining balance: $146.00. I used the restroom and rinsed off my face. <em>Almost,</em> I said to my strained face in the mirror.</p>
<p>“Can I get a large iced hazelnut coffee?” I asked. The man wheezing behind the counter masticated me with his eyes. “You’re back?” He handed me the change.</p>
<h2 id="“Excuse-Me-”"><a href="#“Excuse-Me-”" class="headerlink" title="“Excuse Me?”"></a>“Excuse Me?”</h2><p>“You were in here yesterday. You got that same coffee.” “No. I. Did. Not.” I shook my head for emphasis. I imagined myself getting out of the car yesterday, tomorrow, and every day of my new life, pulling into the Dunkin’ Donuts in motherfucking New Jersey, and ordering that coffee. I felt sick. “I didn’t,” I said again, still shaking my head. “I’m back, it’s me,” I said to the tollbooth woman, rolling the window down triumphantly. She raised one eyebrow and hooked her thumb into her belt loop. I handed her money like it was nothing. “Can I get in now?”</p>
<p>SALT: your mouth waters itself. Flakes from Brittany, liquescent on contact. Blocks of pink salt from the Himalayas, matte gray clumps from Japan. An endless stream of kosher salt, falling from Chef’s hand. Salting the most nuanced of enterprises, the food always requesting more, but the tipping point fatal. - A FRIEND OF a friend of a friend, his name was Jesse. A spare bedroom for $700 a month. A neighborhood called Williamsburg. The city was in the grips of a tyrannical heat wave, the daily papers headlined with news of people dying in Queens and the outer boroughs where there were blackouts. The cops were passing out bags of ice, an evaporating consolation. The streets were wide and vacant and I parked my car on Roebling. It was midafternoon, there wasn’t enough shade, and every business seemed closed. I walked over to Bedford Avenue to look for signs of life. I saw a coffee shop and thought about asking if they needed a barista. When I looked through the window the kids on laptops were thin lipped, pierced, gaunt, so much older than me. I had promised myself to find work swiftly and unthinkingly - as a waitress, a barista, a whatever-the-fuck-job so I could feel planted. But when I told myself to open the door my hand objected. The waterfront skyline was plastered with skeletons of high-rises, escalating out of the low buildings. They looked like mistakes that had been rubbed out with an eraser. Creaking above an overgrown, abandoned lot was a rusted-out Mobil gas sign - all around me ambivalent evidence of extinction. This new roommate had left the keys at a bar near the apartment. He worked in an office in Midtown during the day and couldn’t meet me. Clem’s was a dark spot on a bright corner, the air conditioner rumbling like a diesel motor. It anointed me with a drip when I walked in, and I stood blinking in the airstream while my eyes adjusted. There was a bartender leaning heavily against the back counter with his boots up on the bar in front of him. He wore a patched and studded denim vest with no shirt underneath. Two women sat in front of him in yellow print dresses, twirling straws in big drinks. No one said anything to me. “Keys, keys, keys,” he said when I asked. In addition to his body odor, which hit me in the face on my approach, this man was covered in terrifying - demonic - tattoos. The skin of his ribs seemed glued on. A mustache as defined as pigtails. He pulled out the register, threw it on the bar, and rummaged through the drawer underneath. Stacks of credit cards, foreign change, envelopes, receipts. The bills fluttered against the clamps. “You Jesse’s girl?” “Ha,” one of the women said from down the bar. She pressed her drink onto her forehead and rolled it back and forth. “That was funny.” “It’s South Second and Roebling,” I said. “Am I a fucking real estate agent?” He threw a handful of keys with plastic colored tags at me. “Aw, don’t scare her,” the second woman said. They didn’t look like sisters exactly, but they were both fleshy, rising out of their halter necklines like figureheads on the prow of a ship. One was blond, the other brunette - and now that I was looking, their dresses were definitely identical. They murmured inside jokes to each other. How am I going to live here? I wondered. Someone is going to have to change, them or me. I found the keys marked 220 Roebling. The bartender ducked down. “Thank you very much, sir,” I said to the air. “Oh, no problem, madame,” he said, popping up and batting his eyes at me. He opened a can of beer, pushed his mustache up, and ran his tongue around it while looking at me. “Okay,” I said, backing away. “Well, maybe I’ll come in again. For like…a drink.” “I’ll be here with bells on,” he said, turning his back on me. His stench lingered. Just before I stepped out into the heat I heard one of the women say, “Oh god,” and then from that bartender: “There goes the fucking neighborhood.”</p>
<p>SWEET: granular, powdered, brown, slow like honey or molasses. The mouth-coating sugars in milk. Once, when we were wild, sugar intoxicated us, the first narcotic we craved and languished in. We’ve tamed, refined it, but the juice from a peach still runs like a flash flood.</p>
<p>I DON’T REMEMBER why I went to that restaurant first. I do remember - in perfect detail - that stretch of Sixteenth Street that gave away so little: the impersonal, midcentury teal of Coffee Shop, the battalion of dumpsters between us and Blue Water Grill, the bodega with two small card tables where they let you drink beer. Always uniformed servers buying Altoids and energy drinks. The alley where the cooks lined up to smoke cigarettes between services, the recesses of the alley where they smoked pot and kicked at the rats tearing through the trash. And just beyond our line of vision we could sense the outlines of the scrawny park.</p>
<h2 id="What-Did-The-Owner-Gaze-At-When-He-Built-It-The-Future"><a href="#What-Did-The-Owner-Gaze-At-When-He-Built-It-The-Future" class="headerlink" title="What Did The Owner Gaze At When He Built It? The Future."></a>What Did The Owner Gaze At When He Built It? The Future.</h2><p>When I got there they told me a lot of stories. Nobody went to Union Square in the eighties, they said. Only a few of the publishing houses had moved down there. That city has been replaced by another city. The Whole Foods, the Barnes &amp; Noble, the Best Buy - they got stacked right on top of it. In Rome, they dig for a subway and find whole civilizations. With all the artists, the politicians, the tailors, the hairdressers, the bartenders. If you dug right here on Sixteenth Street you’d find us, younger, and all the stale haunts, and all the old bums in the park younger too. What did those original servers see when they went to the first interviews in 1985? A tavern, a grill, a bistro? A mess of Italy, France, and some burgeoning American cuisine that nobody really believed in yet? A hodgepodge that shouldn’t have worked? When I asked them what they saw, they said he’d built a kind of restaurant that hadn’t been there before. They all said that when they walked in, it felt like coming home.</p>
<p>BITTER: always a bit unanticipated. Coffee, chocolate, rosemary, citrus rinds, wine. Once, when we were wild, it told us about poison. The mouth still hesitates at each new encounter. We urge it forward, say, Adapt. Now, enjoy it.</p>
<p>I SMILED too much. At the end of the interview the corners of my mouth ached like stakes in a tent. I wore a black sundress and a pilled cardigan, which was the most conservative and professional thing I owned. I had a handful of résumés folded up in my purse, and my loose plan - if that’s even the right word for the hesitant brand of instinct I forced myself to follow with a sense of doom - was to walk into restaurants until I got hired. When I asked my roommate where I should look for a job, he said the best restaurant in New York City was in Union Square. Within a minute of getting off the train I developed giant wet half-moons of sweat in the cardigan, but the top of my dress was too revealing to remove it. “Why did you choose New York?” asked Howard, the general manager. “I thought you were going to ask me why I chose this restaurant,” I said. “Let’s start with New York.”<br>I knew from books, movies, and <em>Sex and the City</em> how I was supposed to answer. I’ve always dreamed of living here, they say.</p>
<p>They stress the word <em>dreamed,</em> lengthen it, to make it sound true.</p>
<p>I knew so many said: I came here to be a singer/dancer/actress/ photographer/painter. In finance/fashion/publishing. I came here to be powerful/beautiful/wealthy. This always seemed to mean: I’m stopping here to become someone else. I said, “It really didn’t feel like a choice. Where else is there to go?” “Ah,” he said. “It’s a bit of a calling, isn’t it?”<br>That’s all. Ah. And I felt like he understood that I didn’t have endless options, that there was only one place large enough to hold so much unbridled, unfocused desire. Ah. Maybe he knew how I<br>fantasized about living a twenty-four-hour life. Maybe he knew how bored I had been up until now. Howard was in his late forties with a cultivated, square face. His hair receded finely, emphasizing bulging eyes that told me he didn’t need much sleep. He stood squarely on athletic legs, balancing a prominent belly. Judicious eyes, I thought, as he tapped his fingers on the white tablecloth and assessed me. “You have nice nails,” I said, looking at his hands. “It’s part of the job,” he said, unswayed. “Tell me what you know about wine.” “Oh, the basics. I’m competent in the basics.” As in I knew the difference between white and red wine and it couldn’t get more basic than that. “For example,” he said, looking around the room as if plucking a question from the air, “what are the five noble grapes of Bordeaux?” I pictured cartoon grapes wearing crowns on their heads, welcoming me to their châteaux - Hello, we are the noble grapes of Bordeaux, they said. I debated lying. It was impossible to know how much honesty about my ignorance would be valued.</p>
<h2 id="“Mer…Lot-”"><a href="#“Mer…Lot-”" class="headerlink" title="“Mer…Lot?”"></a>“Mer…Lot?”</h2><p>“Yes,” he said. “That’s one.” “Cabernet? I’m sorry, I don’t really drink Bordeaux.” He seemed sympathetic. “Of course, it’s a bit above the average price point.” “Yep.” I nodded. “That’s totally it.”</p>
<h2 id="“What-Do-You-Drink-”"><a href="#“What-Do-You-Drink-”" class="headerlink" title="“What Do You Drink?”"></a>“What Do You Drink?”</h2><p>My first instinct was to list the different beverages I drank on a daily basis. The noble grapes were back in my head, dancing, telling him all about my Dunkin’ Donuts iced coffee. “What do I drink when?” “When you purchase a bottle of wine, what do you tend toward?” I imagined myself purchasing a bottle of wine, not based on price or proximity to the checkout line, not based on what animal was on the label, but by an internal matrix of my own taste. That image was as laughable as my noble grapes, even if I was wearing a cardigan. “Beaujolais? Is that a wine?” “It is. Beaujolais, c’est un vin fainéant et radin.” “Yes. That.” “Which cru do you prefer?” “I’m not sure,” I said, batting my eyelashes forcibly, falsely. “Do you have any experience as a server?” “Yes. I’ve been working at that coffee shop for years. It’s on my résumé.” “I mean in a restaurant. Do you know what it means to be a server?”<br>“Yes. When the plates are ready I bring them out and <em>serve</em> them to customers.” “You mean guests.” “Guests?” “Your guests.” “Yes, that’s what I meant.” He scribbled on the top of my résumé. Server? Guests? What was the difference between a guest and a customer? “It says here you were an English major.” “Yes. I know. It’s generic.” “What are you reading?” “Reading?” “What are you reading right now?”</p>
<h2 id="“Is-That-A-Job-Question-”"><a href="#“Is-That-A-Job-Question-”" class="headerlink" title="“Is That A Job Question?”"></a>“Is That A Job Question?”</h2><p>“Perhaps.” He smiled. His eyes made an unabashed, slow circle around my face. “Um. Nothing. For the first time in my life, I’m reading nothing.” I paused and looked out the window. I don’t think anyone, even my professors, had once asked me what I was reading. He was digging, and though I had no idea what he was looking for, I decided it was better to play. “You know, Howard, if I can call you that, when I was leaving for here I packed a few boxes of books. But then I really started looking at them. These books were…I don’t know…totems of who I was….I…” My words had a point, I had just felt the point coming, I was trying to tell him the truth. “I left them behind. That’s what I mean.” He rested his cheek on an aristocratic hand. He listened. No, he perceived. I felt perceived. “Yes. It’s startling to look back on the passionate epiphanies of our youth. But a good sign perhaps. That our minds have changed, that we’ve evolved.” “Or maybe it means we’ve forgotten ourselves. And we keep forgetting ourselves. And that’s the big grown-up secret to survival.” I stared out the window. The city passed on, obliviously. If this went badly I would forget it too.</p>
<h2 id="“Are-You-A-Writer-”"><a href="#“Are-You-A-Writer-”" class="headerlink" title="“Are You A Writer?”"></a>“Are You A Writer?”</h2><p>“No,” I said. The table came back into focus. He was looking at me. “I like books. And everything else.” “You like everything else?” “You know what I mean, I like it all. I like being moved.” He made another note on my résumé. “What do you dislike?” “What?” I thought I’d misheard him. “If you like being moved, what do you dislike?” “Are these normal questions?” “This isn’t a normal restaurant.” He smiled and crossed his hands. “Okay.” I looked back out the window. Enough. “I don’t like that question.”</p>
<h2 id="“Why-”"><a href="#“Why-”" class="headerlink" title="“Why?”"></a>“Why?”</h2><p>My palms were damp. That was the moment I realized I wanted the job. That job, at that restaurant specifically. I looked at my hands and said, “It feels a little personal.” “All right.” He didn’t skip a beat, a quick glance at my résumé and he was on track. “Can you tell me about a problem at one of your last jobs? At that coffee shop, I suppose. Tell me about a problem there and how you solved it.” As if I had dreamed it, the interior of the coffee shop dissolved when I tried to recall it directly. And when I tried to remember punching in there, tried to remember the sink, the register, the coffee grinds, the objects faded. And then her fat, gloating, vindictive face appeared. “There was this awful woman, Mrs. Pound. I mean it, she was insufferable. We called her The Hammer. From the second she walked in everything was wrong, the coffee scalded her or it tasted like dirt, the music was too loud, or her blueberry muffin had poisoned her the night before. She was always threatening to shut us down, telling us to get our lawyer ready each time she bumped into a table. She wanted scrambled eggs for her dog. Never tipped us a cent. She was dreaded. But then, this was a little over a year ago, she had her foot amputated. She was diabetic. None of us ever knew, I mean, why would we know? And she would wheel by in her wheelchair and everyone was like, Finally, The Hammer is done.” “Finally, what?” Howard asked. “Oh, I forgot that part. We didn’t have a ramp. And there were stairs. So she was finished, more or less.” “More or less,” he said. “But, the real part of the story. One day she was wheeling by, and she was glaring, I mean, hateful. And I don’t know why, but I missed her. I missed her face. So I made her coffee and I ran after her. I wheeled her across the street to the park and she complained about everything from the weather to indigestion. From then on it was our thing. Every day. I even brought the scrambled eggs in a togo container for her dog. My coworkers made so much fun of me.” The Hammer’s swollen, varicosed legs. Flashing her stump at me from under her housedress. Her purple fingers. “Does that answer your question? The problem was not having a ramp, I guess. The solution was to bring out the coffee. I’m sorry, I didn’t explain it very well.” “I think you explained it perfectly. That was a kind thing to do.” I shrugged. “I really liked her actually.” The Hammer was the only impolite person I knew. She put me in that restaurant. I felt it then but didn’t understand it. It was her niece’s daughter who was a friend of a friend of my new roommate in Williamsburg. Our goodbye had been tearful - on my end, not hers. I promised to write her letters, but the weeks were eclipsing our small relationship. And as I looked at Howard and the perfectly set table and the tasteful hydrangea arrangement between us, I<br>understood what he meant by <em>guest,</em> and I also knew that I would never see her again. “Did you move here with anyone? Girlfriends? A boyfriend?” “No.” “That’s very brave.” “Is it? It’s been two days and I feel pretty foolish.” “It’s brave if you make it, foolish if you fail.” I wanted to ask him how I would be able to tell the difference and when. “If you’re hired here, what do you want the next year to bring you?” I forgot that I was being interviewed. I forgot about my negative bank account, my pit stains, and the noble grapes. I said something about wanting to learn. About my work ethic. I was never good at the future. I grew up with girls whose chief occupation was the future - designing it, instigating it. They could talk about it with so much confidence that it sounded like the past. During those talks, I had contributed nothing. I had visions, too abstract and flat for me to hang on to. For years I saw a generic city lit up at night. I would use those remote, artificial lights to soothe myself to sleep. One day I was quitting my job with no sense of exhilaration, one day I was leaving a note for my father, pulling out of his driveway, slightly bewildered, and two days later I was sitting in front of Howard. That was the way the future came to me. The vision that accompanied me on my drive was a girl, a lady actually. We had the same hair but she didn’t look like me. She was in a camel coat and ankle boots. A dress under the coat was belted high on her waist. She carried various shopping bags from specialty stores and as she was walking, pausing at certain windows, her coat would fly back in the wind. Her boot heels tapped on the cobblestones. She had lovers and breakups, an analyst, a library, acquaintances she ran into on the street whose names she couldn’t call to mind. She belonged to herself only. She had edges, boundaries, tastes, definition down to her eyelashes. And when she walked it was clear she knew where she was going. As I thanked him and we reviewed my contact information, I didn’t know what had transpired, whether it was good or bad. It took me a moment to even remember the name of the restaurant. He held my hand too long and as I stood, his eyes traveled down my body, not like an employer’s, but like a man’s. “I dislike mopping. And lying,” I said. I don’t know why. “Those are the two that come to mind.” He nodded and smiled - what I wanted to call a private smile. The backs of my legs were damp with sweat and as I walked away I felt his eyes unabashedly on my ass. At the door, I rolled my cardigan off my shoulders, and arched as if stretching. No one knows how I got the job, but it’s better to be honest about these things.</p>
<p>TASTE, Chef said, is all about balance. The sour, the salty, the sweet, the bitter. Now your tongue is coded. A certain connoisseurship of taste, a mark of how you deal with the world, is the ability to relish the bitter, to crave it even, the way you do the sweet.</p>
<h2 id="Ii"><a href="#Ii" class="headerlink" title="Ii"></a>Ii</h2><p>THE SPACE WAS aesthetically unremarkable, even ugly in places. Not ragged by any means - the paint fresh, the dust banished - but defiantly past its peak. The art was dated, gaudy, some of it honestly preposterous, purchased in the eighties or whenever. The dining room had three levels, as if it had been built during different periods and linked together as an afterthought. Tables cluttered on one side of the room, sparse on the other. The cumulative effect was like someone hadn’t quite made up his mind, but insisted on having you over anyway.</p>
<p>THE OWNER TOLD ME at orientation, “There are many endeavors to bring pleasure to people. Every artist assumes that challenge. But what we do here is the most intimate. We are making something you take inside you. Not the food, the experience.”</p>
<p>TWO AREAS OF the restaurant were flawless: first, three café-style tables in the front framed by a large window at the entrance. The tables were set in the day’s changing light. Some people - I mean guests—hated to be next to the entrance, to be sectioned off from the main dining rooms. But some of them wouldn’t sit anywhere else. These tables were often held for the most poised guests - rarely a sloucher or anyone in denim. The Owner said, “Running a restaurant means setting a stage. The believability hinges on the details. We control how they experience the world: sight, sound, taste, smell, touch. That starts at the door, with the host and the flowers.” And then, the bar. Timeless: long, dark mahogany, with stools high enough to make you feel like you were afloat. The bar had soft music, dim lighting, tinkling layers of noise, the bumps of a neighbor’s knee, the reach of someone’s arm by your face to take a glittering martini, the tap of a hostess as she escorted guests behind your back, the blur of plates being passed, the rattle of drinks, the virtuoso performance of bartenders slapping bottles into the back bar while also delivering bread, while also taking an order with the requisite substitutions and complications. All the best regulars came in and greeted the hostess saying, Any space at the bar tonight?</p>
<p>“OUR GOAL,” he said, “is to make the guests feel that we are on their side. Any business transaction - actually any life transaction</p>
<ul>
<li>is negotiated by how you are making the other person <em>feel.</em>“ The Owner looked and spoke like a deity. Sometimes the New York Post referred to him as the mayor. Tall, tan, handsome with perfect white teeth, effortless articulation, and gorgeous gesticulation. I listened to him accordingly, with my hands in my lap. Yet there was a tension I couldn’t quite put my finger on. Something false about making guests “feel” that we were on their side. I looked around the room and suddenly everything looked like currency to me: the silver, the wooden beams, the regal floral arrangement crowning the bar. Jesus, I thought, you can get rich by making people <em>feel</em> good about spending their money. We weren’t on their side; we were on the Owner’s side. All the emphasis on details, all the jargon - it was still just a business, right? When orientation was over, I wanted to catch his eye and let him know that I got it. I wanted to ask someone how much of that money I would be taking home. Then I approached him at the exit and he looked me in the eyes. I stopped. He said my name though I hadn’t told him. He shook my hand and nodded like he had already forgiven me for all my shortcomings and would remember my face forever. He said, “We are creating the world as it should be. We don’t have to pay any attention to how it is.”</li>
</ul>
<p>WHEN I GOT the job I didn’t actually get the job. I got to train for the job. And the position was “backwaiter,” which wasn’t the same as being a server. Howard led me up a narrow spiral staircase in the back of the kitchen and deposited me in the locker room. He said, “You’re the new girl now. You have a certain responsibility.” He left without clarifying what that responsibility was. In the corner of the windowless room sat two older Latino men and a woman. They had been speaking in Spanish but were now staring at me. A small electric fan shuddered behind them. I tried a smile.</p>
<h2 id="“Is-There-Somewhere-I-Can-Change-”"><a href="#“Is-There-Somewhere-I-Can-Change-”" class="headerlink" title="“Is There Somewhere I Can Change?”"></a>“Is There Somewhere I Can Change?”</h2><p>“Right here mami,” the woman said. She had unruly black hair, held back by a bandana. Rivulets of sweat made track marks down her face. She pursed her lips. The men with their outsized, destroyed faces. “Okay,” I said. I opened my locker and stuck my face into it, blocking them from my sight. Howard had told me to buy a white button-down shirt, and I put it on over my tank top to avoid undressing. The shirt was as breathable as cardboard. Sweat ran down my back and into my underwear. They began talking again, fanning themselves, walking to a small sink and splashing water on their faces. The room was stacked with chairs in the back, and along the walls were pairs of Crocs and clogs covered in white splotches, with heels worn down to nothing. There was no air, my chest contracted. The door burst open and a man said, “Are you not hungry? Are you coming?” I looked at the three in the corner to make sure he was talking to me. He had an adolescent, tame face, but was irritated, his brows narrowed together. “No, I’m hungry,” I said. I wasn’t, I just wanted something to do. “Well family is almost over. How much more primping do you have left?” I shut my locker door and put my hair back in a ponytail. “I’m done. Are you in charge of me?” “Yes, I’m in charge of you. I’m your trailer. First lesson, if you miss family, you don’t eat.” “Well it’s nice to meet you. I’m—“ “I know who you are.” He slammed the door behind us. “You’re the new girl. Don’t forget to clock in.” - THERE WERE tables in the back dining room set with stainless steel sheet trays and bowls so big I could bathe in them. Macaroni and cheese, fried chicken, potato salad, biscuits, an oily green salad with shredded carrots. Pitchers of iced tea. It looked like food for a large catered event, but my trailer handed me a white plate and started helping himself to family meal. He went and sat at a table in the corner without inviting me to follow. The staff had taken over the back dining room. They came from every department: the servers in aprons, people in white coats, women removing headsets, men in suits, tugging at ties. I sat near the servers, in the very last chair - it was the best seat if I needed to run. Preshift turned out to be a turbulent affair. A frazzled, skittish manager named Zoe was looking at me like it was my fault. She kept calling out numbers or names - things like “Section 6” and “Mr. Blah-blah at eight p.m.” but the servers talked right through her. I nodded deafly. I couldn’t touch my food. The servers looked like actors - each perfectly idiosyncratic, but rehearsed. It all felt staged for my benefit. They wore striped shirts of every color. They were performing, snapping, clapping, kissing, cutting each other off, layers of noise colluding while I sank into my seat. Howard walked up with wineglasses hanging like spokes from his hand. A young man in a suit trailed behind him with a bottle of wine wrapped in brown paper. The servers passed around the glasses with tastes of wine, but one never made it to me. When Howard clapped his hands everyone went silent. “Who would like to begin?” Someone called out, “Pinot, obviously.” “New World or Old?” Howard asked, scanning the room. His eyes fell on me for a second and I dropped my face to my plate. I remembered every time a teacher had called on me and I didn’t know the answer. I remembered wetting my pants in the fourth grade and thought that if he called on me I would again now. “Old World,” a voice called out. “Obviously,” someone else said. “It’s old. I mean, it’s got age - look, it’s beginning to pale.” “So we’re talking Burgundy.” “It’s just a matter of deduction now, HR.” This man lifted his glass and pointed it to Howard. “I’m onto you.” Howard waited. “A little austere to be Côte de Beaune.” “Is it off?” “I was thinking it might be off!” “No, it’s perfect.” They stopped talking. I leaned forward to see who had said that. She was in the same row as me, behind too many people. I saw the bowl of her glass as she pulled it away from her nose and then brought it back. Her voice, low, ponderous, continued: “Côte de Nuits…hmm, Howard, this is a treat. Gevrey-Chambertin, of course. The Harmand-Geoffroy.” She put the glass down in front of her. From what I saw, she hadn’t taken a sip. The wine caught the light rebelliously. “The 2000. It’s actually showing really well.” “I agree, Simone. Thank you.” Howard clapped his hands together. “Friends, this wine is a steal, and don’t let the difficult 2000 vintage put you off. Côte de Nuits was able to pull off some stunning wines and they are drinking well, today, right now, this minute. As far as this gift goes, pass it on to your guests tonight.” Everyone stood up together. The people around me stacked their plates on top of my full one and left. I held them to my chest and pushed through the swinging doors in the kitchen. Two servers walked by on my right and I heard one of them say in a false singsong, “Oh, the Harmand-Geoffroy, of course,” and the other girl rolled her eyes. Someone walked by on my left and said to me, “Seriously? You don’t know what a dishwasher looks like?” I moved toward a trough laden with dirty dishes that ran the length of the room. I set my stack down apologetically. A tiny, gray-haired man on the other side of the trough huffed and took my stack, scraping the food off of each one and into a trash can. “Pinche idiota,” he said, and spat into the trough in front of him. “Thank you,” I said. Maybe I had never actually made a mistake before in my life and this is what it felt like. Like your hands were slipping off of every facet, like you didn’t have the words or directions and even gravity wasn’t reliable. I felt my trailer behind me and spun around to grab him. “Where do I—“ I reached out for an arm and noticed too late that it wasn’t striped. It was bare. There was a static shock when I touched it. “Oh. You’re not my person.” I looked up. Black jeans and a white T- shirt with a backpack on one shoulder. Eyes so pale, a weatherworn, spectral blue. He was covered in sweat and slightly out of breath. I inhaled sharply. “My trailer person I mean. You’re not him.” His eyes were a vise. “Are you sure?” I nodded. He looked me up and down, indiscreetly. “What are you?” “I’m new.” “Jake.” We both turned. The woman who knew the wine stood in the doorway. She didn’t see me. Her gaze distilled the kitchen light to its purest element. “Good morning. What time does your shift start again?” “Oh fuck off Simone.” She smiled, pleased. “I have your plate,” she said, and turned into the dining room. The doors swung back violently. And then all I could see was his feet pounding the last few stairs.</p>
<p>THEY SHOWED ME how to fold. Stacks of plastic-wrapped, blindingly white linens. Crease, turn, crease, fold, fan. Wrap with napkin bands, stack. The servers used that time to catch up, engaging in full conversations. Crease, turn, crease, fold, fan. I was lulled into a trance by the motions, by the lint gathering in my apron. No one addressed me. At least I can fold napkins, I said to myself, over and over. I watched Jake and Simone. He stood at the end of the bar hunched over his plate with his back to me, and she talked without looking at him. She tapped the screen at the computer terminal. I could tell they were attached far underneath the surface of the restaurant. Maybe because they weren’t laughing, or bantering - there was no performance. They were just talking. A girl with a button nose and a debutante’s smile said, “Hey,” and stuck her chewing gum into the napkin on my lap, and the trance was over.</p>
<p>I DIDN’T LOOK UP for weeks. I asked to work as many days as possible, but there was an alarming delay in money while the new paycheck cycle started. And when it came it was training pay. Nothing. With my first paycheck I bought a used mattress for $250 from a couple moving out a few apartments down. “Don’t worry,” they said, “no bugs. It’s full of love.” I took it, but that to me was more disturbing.</p>
<p>ON THE OTHER END of the linen spectrum came the bar mops. Every new trailer opened the session with, “Did someone explain bar mops?” And when I said yes they said, “Who? So-and-so always fucks it up. I have a secret stash.” I learned four different and elaborate systems for managing what were essentially rags they kept under lock and key. There were never enough. We could never attain healthy bar mop equilibrium. The kitchen always needed more, or the guy in the back never got set up before service, or the bartenders went on a cleaning spree. Invariably you forgot to save some for yourself. The victim of this bar mop negligence got to yell at you. When you asked a manager for more, they got to yell at you too, for burning through bar mops before service even started. If you begged - and everyone begged - the manager would unlock the cupboard and count out ten more. You told no one about the ten extra bar mops. You hid them, and then doled them out heroically during emergencies.</p>
<p>“THE KITCHEN IS a church,” Chef screamed at me when I asked my trailer a question. “No fucking talking.” Silence was observed in the kitchen. People entered on tiptoe. The only person allowed to directly address Chef during service was Howard - sometimes the other managers tried to do it and got their heads bitten off. The silence probably helped the cooks, but it made learning anything difficult to impossible.</p>
<p>IN BETWEEN shifts I went to the Starbucks that smelled like a toilet and drank one cup of coffee. On my evening off, I bought individual Coronas from the bodega and drank them on my mattress. I was so tired I couldn’t finish them. Half-empty bottles of warm beer lined my windowsills, looking like urine and filtering sunlight. I put slices of bread from the restaurant into my purse and made myself toast in the mornings. If I had a double I took naps in the park between the shifts. I slept hard, dreaming that I was sinking into the ground, and I felt safe. When I woke I slapped myself to get the grass marks off my cheeks. - NO NAMES. I didn’t know people. I grabbed whatever characteristics I could: crooked or fluorescent teeth, tattoos, accents, lipsticks, I even recognized some people by their gait. It’s not that my trailers were withholding information. I was just so stupid that I couldn’t learn table numbers and names at the same time. They explained to me that this restaurant was different - real paychecks first of all, and health benefits, sick days. Some nonsalaried servers even got hourly raises. People owned homes, had children, took vacations. Everyone had been there years. There were senior servers who would never leave. Debutante-Smile, Guy-with-Clark-Kent-Glasses, Guy-with-Long-Hair-and-Bun, Overweight-Gray-Hair-Guy. Even the backwaiters had been there at least three years. There was Mean- Girl, and Russian-Pouty-Lips, and my first trailer, whom I called Sergeant because of the way he ordered me around. Simone was Wine-Woman, and a senior server. She and Clark-Kent- Glasses had been there the longest. One of my trailers called her the tree of knowledge. Every preshift the maître d’ rearranged the seating chart because regulars demanded to sit in her section. The servers would line up to ask her questions, or they sent her to their VIP tables with a wine list. She never looked at me. And Sweaty-Boy, Jake? In those weeks of training I didn’t see him again. I thought maybe he didn’t work there, had just been filling in that day. But then I came in to pick up my first check on a Friday night and he was there. I put my head down when I saw him. He was a bartender.</p>
<p>“SO I HEARD you’re a barista,” drawled Guy-with-Long-Hair-and- Bun. “That makes my training day real easy.” It was like arriving to a coffee station on another planet. Everything silver, futuristic, elegant. More intelligent than me. “Ever worked on a Marzocco before?” “I’m sorry?” “The machine, the Marzocco. It’s the Cadillac of espresso machines.” All right, all right, I thought. I know how to make fucking coffee. Even a Cadillac was still a car. I picked out the portafilters, saw the grinder, the tamper. “You know the four Ms? What kind of espresso were you guys using?” “The kind that got dropped off in big bags,” I said. “It wasn’t exactly a gourmet place.” “Oh shit, okay, I heard you were a barista. No big deal, I’ll train you and we’ll check in with Howard after—“ “No. No.” I twisted the portafilter out and discharged the spent espresso into the trash can. “Where are your bar mops?” He handed me one and I wiped the basket. “You guys use timers or what?” “We use our eyes.” I exhaled. “Okay.” I turned on the grinder, wiped the steamer wand, flushed out the group head. Twenty-five seconds was a perfect shot of espresso. I would count it myself. “One cappuccino, coming right up.”</p>
<p>I STUDIED the menu, I studied the manual. At the end of every service a manager asked me questions. I found that even if I didn’t know what on earth a Lobster Shepherd’s Pie was, even if I couldn’t imagine it, if I knew it was the Monday night special I was going to pass my trails. Even if I didn’t know what the fuck our tenets meant, I repeated back to Zoe perfectly, “The first tenet is to take care of each other.” “And do you know what makes a fifty-one percenter?” Zoe was eating the hanger steak at her desk in the office. She swirled a piece of it through mashed potatoes and frizzled leeks. I was so hungry I could have slapped her. “Um.” I forgot that the Owner had said to me: “You were hired because you are a fifty-one percenter. That’s not something we can train for - you have to be born with it.” I had no idea what that meant. I looked at the choking sign on the wall. The man asphyxiating in the sign looked calm and I envied him.</p>
<p>FORTY-NINE PERCENT of the job was the mechanics. Anyone can do this job - that’s what I was always told about waitressing. I’m sorry, serving.</p>
<p>You know, just memorize the table numbers and positions, stack plates up along your arm, know all the menu items and their ingredients, never let the water levels drop, never spill a drop of wine, bus the tables cleanly, mise-en-place, fire orders, know the basic characteristics of the basic grape varieties and basic regions of the entire wine world, know the origins of the tuna, pair a wine with the foie gras, know the type of animal the cheeses come from, know what is pasteurized, what contains gluten, what contains nuts, where the extra straws are, how to count. Know how to show up on time. “And what’s the rest of it?” I asked my trailer, out of breath, dabbing paper towels into my armpits. “Oh, the fifty-one percent. That’s the tricky stuff.”</p>
<p>I FLUNG OFF my sweated-through work jeans, twisted the top off a Pacifico because they were out of Corona, and sat on my mattress with the manual. I am a fifty-one percenter, I said to myself. This is Me:</p>
<p>• <em>Unfailingly optimistic:</em> doesn’t let the world get him or her down. • <em>Insatiably curious:</em> and humble enough to ask questions. • <em>Precise:</em> there are no shortcuts. • <em>Compassionate:</em> has a core of emotional intelligence. • <em>Honest:</em> not just with others, but most essentially with oneself.<br>I lay back on the bed and laughed. Rarely, but sometimes, I thought about my old coworkers back in nowhere - where our training consisted of learning how to switch on the coffeepot - watching me sweat and run and parrot back this manual, unable to see five feet in front of me. They watched me spend every clocked-in moment blind and terrified, and then we laughed about it. The corner of South Second and Roebling was crowded with Puerto Rican families in their lawn chairs with adjacent coolers. They played dominoes. Kids screamed through the stream from a detonated hydrant. I watched them and thought back to that coffee shop on Bedford from the first day. I could probably walk in there now. I would say, Yeah I’ve worked on a Marzocco - oh, you don’t know it? But it wouldn’t be enough. Whatever it was, just being a backwaiter, a server, a barista - at this restaurant I wasn’t just anything. And I wouldn’t call it being a fifty-one percenter because that sounded like a robot. But I felt marked. I felt noticed, not just by my coworkers who scorned me, but by the city. And every time a complaint, a moan, or an eye roll rose to the surface, I smiled instead. AND ONE DAY I ran up the stairs into the locker room and a woman from the office followed me. She carried three hangers hung with stiff, striped Brooks Brothers button-downs. They were the androgynous kind of shirt that straddles the line between the boardroom and a circus. “Congratulations,” she said in monotone, like her clothes. “These are your stripes.” I put them in my locker and stared at them. I wasn’t training anymore. I had a job. At the most popular restaurant in New York City. I fingered the shirts and it happened: The escape was complete. I put on navy stripes. I thought I felt a breeze. It was as if I were coming out of anesthesia. I saw, I recognized, a person. - SHE STOPPED ME on my first steps into the dining room, holding a glass of wine in her hand. I had the fleeting impression that she had been waiting for me a long time. “Open your mouth,” Simone said, her head raised, imperious. Both of us looked at each other. She painted her lips before each service with an unyielding shade of red. She had dark-blond hair, untamable, frizzy, wisped out from her face like a seventies rock goddess. But her face was strict, classical. She held the glass of wine out to me and waited. I threw it back like a tequila shot, an accident, a habit. “Open your mouth now,” she commanded me. “The air has to interact with the wine. They flower together.” I opened my mouth but I had already swallowed. “Tasting is a farce,” she said with her eyes closed, nose deep in the bowl of the glass. “The only way to get to know a wine is to take a few hours with it. Let it change and then let it change you. That’s the only way to learn anything - you have to live with it.”</p>
<p>I HAD the next day off and wanted to celebrate. I took myself to the Met. The servers were always talking about the shows they saw - music, film, theater, art. I didn’t know a single thing they mentioned though I had taken an Intro to Art History course in college. I went because I needed something to contribute during napkin time. I don’t know how long I had been in the city, but when I got off the train at Eighty-Sixth Street I realized how narrowly I had been living. My days were contained to five square blocks in Union Square, the L train, and five square blocks in Williamsburg. When I saw the trees in Central Park I laughed out loud. The lobby of the Met - that holy labyrinth - appropriately took my breath away. I imagined being interviewed ten years from now. Not like with Howard where I was tested, but interviewed with admiration. My amicable interviewer would ask me about my origins. I would tell him that for so long I thought I would be nothing; that my loneliness had been so total that I was unable to project into the future. And that this changed when I got to the city and my present expanded, and my future skipped out in front of me. I stuck to the Impressionist galleries. They were paintings I had seen a hundred times reproduced in books. They were the rooms that people dozed in. Your body could go into a kind of coma from the dreamscapes, but if the mind was alert, the paintings galvanized. They were almost confrontational. “And that confirmed what I had always suspected,” I told my interviewer. “That my life before the city had only been a reproduction.” After I ran out of rooms I started again. Cézanne, Monet, Manet, Pissarro, Degas, Van Gogh. “This is what I want,” I said, showing my interviewer the painting of Van Gogh’s cypresses. “Do you see how, up close, it’s blurry and passionate? And from a distance, whole?” “And what about love?” my interviewer asked me, unprompted, as I stared at Cézanne’s apples. For a second I saw Simone’s red lips asking the question. “Love?” I looked around the gallery for the answer. I had wandered out of Impressionism, into early Symbolism. Where a moment earlier I could have sworn the room was crowded, it was now nearly empty except for an elderly man who stood with a cane and a younger woman holding his arm in support. When I was driving to the city I had said to myself, I’m not one of those girls who moves to New York to fall in love. Now, in front of a jury of Symbolists, Simone, and the old man, my denial felt thin. “I don’t know anything about it yet,” I said. I moved next to the man and his friend. His huge ears looked like they were carved of wax, and I was sure he was deaf. He was too at peace. We looked at Klimt’s woman in white, <em>Portrait of Serena Lederer,</em> the title said. She certainly wasn’t one of his most daring, and stood in contrast to his later gold-leafed, erotic works. But though she looked like a virginal column, she had in her face a restrained joy. I remembered something about an affair between the artist and the model, rumors that her daughter was actually Klimt’s. She stood above the three of us, unconcerned with being stared at. The old man smiled at me before he walked off. “Show me,” I said to the woman in white. We regarded each other and waited.</p>
<p>I GOT OFF the train and the streets were glowing. I went to the wine stall in the mini-mall on North Fifth and Bedford. The man behind the counter had long hair and tired, hanging eyes. He turned down the Biggie he’d been blasting when I came in. I looked at every single bottle, but I didn’t recognize anything. Finally, after ten minutes, I asked, “Do you have an affordable Chardonnay?” He had paint all over him and a cigarette behind his ear. “What kind of Chardonnay do you like?” “Um,” I swallowed. “France?” He nodded. “Yeah, that’s the only kind, right? None of that Cali shit. How’s this? I have one cold.” I paid him and held the bag to my chest. I ran home, crossing to the opposite side of Grand Street so I wouldn’t be contaminated by the demons lounging outside of Clem’s. I ran up my four flights of stairs too, ran into the apartment, stole Jesse’s wine key and a mug, and ran up the last flight, pushing out onto the roof. The sky was like the paintings. No, the paintings were trying to represent this sunset. The sky was aflame and throwing sparks, the orange clouds rimmed with purple like ash. The windows in each high-rise in Manhattan were lit up like the buildings were burning down. I was out of breath, overtired from the museum. My heart drummed. A voice said, You have to live with it. Another voice said, You made it, you made it, and at the same time, in a blistering chorus I said, Made it where? Live with what?</p>
<p>I WALKED IN on them in the locker room. Simone had been speaking loudly, sitting in a spare chair in her stripes with her legs crossed. He was standing in front of his locker, buttoning his shirt. They both looked at me, startled. “Sorry. Do you want me to come back?” “Of course not,” she said. But neither of them said anything else. The silence was accusatory. He dropped his pants, stepped out of them, and turned back to Simone. “Ignore him,” she said. It sounded like an order, so I obeyed. I looked away.</p>
<p>“PICK UP” was the call. “Picking up” was the echo. “Six and six, table 45, share,” Chef said. His eyes didn’t leave the board of tickets in front of him. “Pick up.” I put my hands in front of me and grabbed. Another sweltering day. Air conditioners all around the city were giving up. As I pushed into the tepid dining room I noticed the ice was melting in the oyster tray in my hands. Pale blue bodies amid sloshing ice chips. It looked disgusting. And six and six meant nothing to me. I had forgotten to check the day’s oysters. I forgot the table I was going to. Simone flooded by me and I reached for her. “Excuse me, Simone, sorry, but which are which oyster? Do you know?” “Do you remember when you tasted them?” She didn’t look at the plate. I hadn’t tasted them when they had been passed around at family meal. I hadn’t looked at the menu notes. “Do you remember tasting them?” she asked again, slowly, like I was dumb. “East Coast oysters are brinier, more mineral. West Coasts are plumper, creamier, sweeter. They’re even physically different. One has a flat cup, the other tends to be deeper.” “Okay, so which are which on this plate?” I held the plate closer to her face but she wouldn’t look. “Those are covered in water. Take them back to Chef.” I shook my head. Absolutely not. “You’re not going to serve those. Take them back to Chef.” I shook my head again but sucked in my lips. I saw it all unfolding ahead of me. His anger at me, his yelling about the waste, my embarrassment. But I could look at the menu notes while I waited for the new ones. I could hear the table number again. I could figure it out. “Okay.” “Next time look at them but use your tongue.”</p>
<p>THE MANAGERS MAINTAINED power by shifting things. They came into a server’s station and moved their dupe pad, moved their checks, rearranged the tickets on the bar. They pulled white wines out of the ice bucket, wiped them down, and reinserted them in a new pattern. They would pause you when you were running, obviously in a hurry, and ask you how you thought you were settling in. Simone maintained power by centrifugal force. When she moved, the restaurant was pulled as if by a tailwind. She led the servers by her ability to shift their focus - her own focus was a spotlight. Service unfolded in her parentheses.</p>
<p>“WHAT’S THAT bartender’s name again? The one who only talks to Simone?” I asked Sasha. I was casual about it. Sasha was a backwaiter. He was otherworldly beautiful: broad alien cheekbones, blue eyes, bee-stung, haughty lips. He could have been a model, except he was barely five foot four. His gaze was so cold, you knew he had been everyone: a rich man, a poor man, in love, abandoned, a murderer, and close to death. None of these states impressed him much. “That bartender? Jake.” He was Russian, and though he was clearly fluent in English, he didn’t bother to adhere to its rules. His accent was both elegant and comical. He rolled his eyes at me while he cut bread. “Okay, Pollyanna, let me tell you few truths. You’re too new.” “What does that mean?” “What you think it means? Jakey will eat you for dinner and spit you out. You even know what I’m speaking of? You’re not bouncing around after that.” I shrugged like I didn’t care and filled the bread baskets. “Besides. He’s mine. I’ll cut your fucking throat if you touch him and I’m not a joker.” “Silence in the kitchen! Pick up.”</p>
<h2 id="“Picking-Up-”"><a href="#“Picking-Up-”" class="headerlink" title="- “Picking Up!”"></a>- “Picking Up!”</h2><p>The kitchen was a riot of misshapen, ugly tomatoes. They smelled like the green insides of plants, like sap, like dirt. There were tomatoes of every color: yellow, green, orange, redpurple, mottled, striped, dotted. They were bursting. “Seaming” is what Chef called it, when the curves and indentations pulled apart from each other, but not completely, like parted lips. “Heirloom season,” Ariel sang out. She was also a backwaiter. She always had pounds of eyeliner on, even if it was the morning. She had bangs and dark-brown hair that she twisted up onto her head and held with chopsticks. She was still named Mean-Girl in my head because she wouldn’t speak to me during training, only pointed and gave exasperated sighs. But today she was passing out dripping bar mops to the line cooks from a bucket of ice water. They wrapped them around their heads like bandanas or slung them over the backs of their necks. That didn’t seem like something a Mean-Girl would do. In fact, I hadn’t seen anyone do something that compassionate with their bar mop stash. I heard from my own head, Our first tenet is to take care of each other. She handed me a bar mop. I put it on the back of my neck and it felt like rising out of a soggy cloud into clean air.</p>
<h2 id="“Pick-Up-”"><a href="#“Pick-Up-”" class="headerlink" title="“Pick Up.”"></a>“Pick Up.”</h2><p>“Picking up,” I said. I looked expectantly to the window but there were no plates lined up. Instead Scott, the young, tattooed sous chef, passed me a sliver of tomato. The insides were tie-dyed pink and red. “A Marvel-Striped from Blooming Hill Farm,” he said, as if I had asked him a question. I cupped it while it dripped. He pinched up flakes of sea salt from a plastic tub and flicked it on the slice. “When they’re like this don’t fuck with them. Just a little salt.” “Wow,” I said. And I meant it. I had never thought of a tomato as a fruit - the ones I had known were mostly white in the center and rock hard. But this was so luscious, so tart I thought it victorious. So - some tomatoes tasted like water, and some tasted like summer lightning.</p>
<p>“WHAT ARE HEIRLOOMS?” I asked Simone as I ran to get behind her in line for family meal. She had two white plates in her hand and I felt a shiver of expectation looking at that second plate. I noted how she made her own - a generous tongful of green salad and a cup of the vichyssoise. “Exciting, isn’t it? The season? They’re rare or unique breeds of plants and animals. Once all our tomatoes were like that. Before preservatives and supermarkets and this commercial food production hell we’re living in. Breeds evolved in places based on one evolutionary principle: they tasted better. The point is not longevity or flawlessness. All of our vegetables were biologically diverse, pungent with the nuances of their breed. They reflected their specific time and space - their terroir.” On the second plate she took the biggest pork chop on the bone, a scoop of the rice salad, and a wedge of gratin potatoes. She said, “Now everything tastes like nothing.”</p>
<p>THEY CONJOINED in my mind. It wasn’t that they were always together. Theirs was an oblique connection, not always direct. If I saw one, my eyes started to move, looking for the other. Simone was easy to find, ubiquitous, directing everyone - she seemed to have some sort of system where she divided her attention between the servers equally. But I had a harder time tracking him, his alliances, his rhythms. If they were in the restaurant together they had one eye on each other and I had one eye on them, trying to understand what I was seeing. It wasn’t like they were the only fascinating people at the restaurant. But they were an island if the rest of us were the continent - distant, inaccessible, picking up stray light.</p>
<h2 id="“Pick-Up-”-1"><a href="#“Pick-Up-”-1" class="headerlink" title="- “Pick Up.”"></a>- “Pick Up.”</h2><p>My eyes snapped open but I was the barista today, the kitchen was far away. Howard looked at me from the Micros terminal. He was waiting for me to make him a macchiato but I was overthinking it. I threw the first two shots away. “I’m hearing Chef scream, ‘Pick up’ in my sleep,” I said, swirling the warm milk. It was as glossy as new paint. “Punishing myself I guess.” “Thanatos - the death drive,” Howard said. He laid a napkin over his arm and inspected a bottle of wine on the service bar. “We fantasize about traumatizing events to maintain our equilibrium. Lovely.” He took the macchiato and smelled it before taking a sip. He regarded me. The other managers wore suits but somehow everyone in the restaurant always knew that Howard was the man in charge - as if his suits were cut from a finer fabric. “It’s compulsive but we actually find the painful repetition pleasurable.” He took another sip.</p>
<h2 id="“It-Doesn’T-Sound-Pleasurable-”"><a href="#“It-Doesn’T-Sound-Pleasurable-”" class="headerlink" title="“It Doesn’T Sound Pleasurable.”"></a>“It Doesn’T Sound Pleasurable.”</h2><p>“It’s how we self-soothe. How we maintain the illusion that we are in control of our lives. For example, you repeat ‘Pick up’ in hopes that the outcome each time will be different. And you are repeatedly embarrassed, are you not?” He waited for me to respond but I wouldn’t meet his eyes. “You are hoping to master the experience. The pain is what we know. It’s our barometer of reality. We never trust pleasure.” Every time Howard looked at me I felt bare. A coffee ticket printed up and I used it as an excuse to turn around. “Are you dreaming about work often?” he asked. It felt like he spoke it into my neck. “No.” I slammed a portafilter to empty it and I could feel him walk away. But I was. The dreams were tidal, consumptive, chaotic. Service played over in my head, but no one had faces. And I heard voices, layered on top of one another, a cacophony. Phrases would rise then evanesce: Behind You, Pick Up, To Your Right, To Your Left, Picking Up, Candles, Can You, Now, Toothpicks, Pick Up, Bar Mops, Now, Excuse Me, Picking Up. In my dreams these words were a code. I was blind and the directives were all I had to pick my way through the blackness. The syllables quaked and separated. I woke up talking: I couldn’t remember what I had been saying, only that I was driven to keep saying it.</p>
<p>TERROIR. I looked it up in <em>The World Atlas of Wine</em> in the manager’s office. The definition was people talking around it without identifying it. It seemed a bit far-fetched. That food had character, composed of the soil, the climate, the time of year. That you could taste that character. But still. An idea mystical enough to be highly seductive.</p>
<p>IGNORE HIM. That’s what I did. When Jake came into family meal late and took his seat next to Simone, when he pulled up on his bike outside the front window, when he called harshly out for bar mops,</p>
<h2 id="I-Looked-Away"><a href="#I-Looked-Away" class="headerlink" title="I Looked Away."></a>I Looked Away.</h2><p>But I started to hear things, all of it unverifiable and improbable. Jake was a musician, a poet, a carpenter. He had lived in Berlin, he had lived in Silver Lake, he had lived in Chinatown. He was halfway through a PhD on Kierkegaard. They called his apartment “the opium den.” He was bisexual, he slept with everyone, he slept with no one. He was an ex - heroin addict, he was sober, he was always a little drunk. He and Simone were not a couple though their magnetic, unconscious way of tracking each other seemed to indicate otherwise. I knew they were very old friends, and that she had gotten him the job. Some nights a cherubic strawberry blonde that Sasha called Nessa-Baby came and sat in front of Jake at the bar as service was winding down. He knew part of his job was to be looked at. He was a quiet bartender. There was a submissiveness to his beauty that was nearly feminine, a stillness that made one want to paint him. When he worked the bar he submitted. Women and men of all ages left business cards and phone numbers with their tips. Guests gave him gifts for no reason - that kind of beauty. If he rolled up his shirtsleeves, you could see the edges of tattoos that spoke to another private body he kept. It was the sight of his arm resting on the beer tap that changed me. The beer was acting up. The kegs were probably too new, not cold enough. Just foam, no beer. Jake let the foam pour while he talked to a guest. The drain was full of foam, it ran over to his feet, a spreading white pool. His sleeve was rolled up, the tendons of his forearm tensed from shaking cocktails. I remembered that static shock when I touched him. I felt the shock in my mouth. His inappropriate forearm and the foam cascading, his manner too casual, too condescending. “That’s a lot of beer to waste,” I said. My voice surprised me, ringing out over my vow of silence. He looked at me. Perhaps it was raining that night, a stifling tropical storm. Perhaps someone struck a match and held it to my cheek. Perhaps someone cleaved my life into before and after. He looked at me. And then he laughed. From that moment on he became unbearable to me.</p>
<h2 id="You-Will-Encounter-A-Fifth-Taste"><a href="#You-Will-Encounter-A-Fifth-Taste" class="headerlink" title="- You Will Encounter A Fifth Taste."></a>- You Will Encounter A Fifth Taste.</h2><p>Umami: uni, or sea urchin, anchovies, Parmesan, dry-aged beef with a casing of mold. It’s glutamate. Nothing is a mystery anymore. They make MSG to mimic it. It’s the taste of ripeness that’s about to ferment. Initially, it serves as a warning. But after a familiarity develops, after you learn its name, that precipice of rot becomes the only flavor worth pursuing, the only line worth testing.</p>
<h2 id="Iv"><a href="#Iv" class="headerlink" title="Iv"></a>Iv</h2><p>The sardines are insane tonight.</p>
<p>It’s true, Chef called him a faggot.</p>
<p>HR is freaking out. Have you been to Ssäm bar yet? No, the best Chinese is in Flushing. I’m playing a show Wednesday. Scott is on fire. I was obsessed with Chekhov. I’m obsessed with Campari right now. I need to get my cameras out again. I’m fairly well known in the experimental dance world. Table 43 is industry - Per Se? If one more bitch cuts me off to ask for Chardonnay— If one more person asks for steak sauce— What the fuck? Carson is in again - without the wife. That’s twice this week. Sometimes I think, Fuck the pooled house. I’m not jealous. Technically I texted first. But he responded. You don’t get it. I’m on day three - I feel great, high all the time. Will you water 24? Will you drop bread on 49? Move. Fuck off. Fuck you. It’s like the rude Olympics in here today. They’re just French. And after I took the LSAT, I was like wait, I don’t want to be a lawyer. I still paint sometimes. I just need space. And time. And money. It’s so hard in New York. Allergy on 61. It’s not really romantic. I’d fuck the mom. Does she come in drunk? It’s just lemon, maple syrup, and cayenne. It’s just Nicky’s martinis, never drink more than one. I just need representation. It’s like banging against a brick wall. I need soupspoons on 27. Chef wants to see you - now. I’m dropping soup now. What did I do? Fuck - the midcourse.</p>
<h2 id="“Pick-Up-”-2"><a href="#“Pick-Up-”-2" class="headerlink" title="- “Pick Up.”"></a>- “Pick Up.”</h2><p>The tickets came from a printer on Chef’s right. They flew into the air like an exclamation and fluttered down in a wave. He yelled: “Fire Gruyère. Fire tartare. Hold calamari. Hold two smokers.” From that code the cooks on the line went into action. Chef lined up the tickets, bouncing from foot to foot like a child who had to go to the bathroom. He was a small man from New Jersey but classically trained in France. He screamed anecdotes at the cooks, recalling “real” kitchens where chefs would slam you in the head with a copper pan if you couldn’t chop the parsley fine enough. Chef’s voice was too loud and he couldn’t really control it. The servers and managers were always complaining that you could hear him from the dining room. Everyone, even Scott, his number two, kept their eyes averted if he was on a tirade. The man paced the kitchen redfaced, primed for explosion. The line cooks were a blur of movement while essentially staying in one place. Everything was within arm’s reach in their stations. Sweat funneled off their eyelashes. There were open flames or salamanders at their backs and heat lamps in the pass at their front. They wiped the rim of each plate before passing it to Chef, who inspected it mercilessly, eager to find smudges of stray sauce or olive oil.</p>
<h2 id="“Pick-Up-”-3"><a href="#“Pick-Up-”-3" class="headerlink" title="“Pick Up!”"></a>“Pick Up!”</h2><p>“Picking up.” I was the food runner, I was next. I covered my hands with bar mops. The plates heated up like irons, I expected them to glow. “I heard you don’t know the oysters yet,” said Will, startling me. Will was Sergeant, the guy who’d been in charge of me on my first day. Even though I had my stripes now, he still seemed to think I was his project. “Jesus,” I said. “Everything is a lesson around here. It’s just dinner.” “You don’t get to say that yet.” “Pick! Up!” “Picking up,” I responded. “Pick up!” “Louder,” said Will, nudging me forward. “Picking up,” I said, harder, hands outstretched, ready. It was all one motion. The roasted half duck had been in the window for going on five minutes while it waited for the risotto, the plate baking. At first, as with all burns, I felt nothing. I reacted in anticipation. When the plate shattered and the duck thudded clumsily onto the mats, I cried out, pulling my hand to my chest, caving. Chef looked at me. He had never really seen me before. “Are you kidding me?” he asked. Quiet. All the line cooks, butchers, prep guys, pastry girls watched me. “I burned myself.” I held out my palm, already streaked with red, as proof.</p>
<p>“Are you <em>fucking</em> kidding me?” Louder. A rumbling, then quiet. Even the tickets stopped printing. “Where do you come from? What kind of bullshit TGI Fridays waitresses are they bringing in now? You think that’s a <em>burn</em>? Do you want me to call your mommy?”<br>“The plates are too hot,” I said. And then I couldn’t take it back. I stared at his feet, at the mess on the floor. I bent over to pick up the beautifully burnished duck. I thought he might hit me. I flinched, but held it out to him by its leg. “Are you retarded? Get out of my kitchen. Don’t even think about setting foot in here again. This is a church.” He slammed his hands on the stainless steel in front of him. “A fucking church!” His eyes went back to the board and he said, quiet again, “Refire, duck, refire risotto, on the fly, what the fuck are you looking at Travis, keep your eyes on your steak before you turn it to cardboard.” I set the duck on the counter next to the bread. The grating noise of tickets printing, of plates being thrown around, of pans hitting burners, it all throbbed with my hand. In the locker room I went to the sink and ran lukewarm water on it. The mark was already starting to disappear. I cried and continued crying while I changed out of my uniform. I sat on a chair and tried to calm down before I went back downstairs. Will opened the door. “I know,” I yelled. “I fucked up. I know.” “Let me see your hand.” He crouched next to me. I opened my palm and he put a bar mop filled with ice cubes into it. I started crying again. “You’re okay, doll.” He patted my shoulder. “Put your stripes on. You can work the dining room.” I nodded. I put on fresh mascara and went downstairs.</p>
<p>THE MEZZ WAS seven two-tops on a balcony over the back dining room. The stairs were narrow, steep, treacherous. “A lawsuit waiting to happen,” they told me. I took them one at a time, up and down, and still soups spilled onto rims, sauces slid. Heather was Debutante-Smile, and she got in trouble weekly for chewing gum on the floor. She was from Georgia, with a delicate southern accent. They told me she had the highest tip average, and everyone blamed the accent. I thought it might be the gum. “Sweetness”—she snapped her gum at me—“start the stairs with your left foot when you go down. Lean back.” I nodded. “I heard about Chef. It happens.” I nodded again. “You know, nobody is from here. We were all new. And like I always say, it’s just dinner.”</p>
<p>FROM A SECTION of the handbook I neglected to read: Workers were to receive one complimentary shift drink after they clocked out. Workers were also to receive one complimentary shift coffee per eight-hour shift. When this translated off the page, quantities increased, entitlement ran rampant. But I didn’t know that yet. They wound us up, they wound us down.</p>
<p>“TAKE A SEAT, new girl.” Nicky was definitely talking to me. I had just clocked out and changed. I was cracking my wrists and heading toward the exit. It was still a touch early. Cooks were plastic-wrapping the kitchen, servers swiping the final credit cards and waiting in the hutches. The dishwashers piled trash bags at the exit of the kitchen. I saw them peeking out, trembling like sprinters, waiting for the signal that they could take the bags to the curb and go home. “Where?” “At the bar.” He wiped down a spot. Nicky was Clark-Kent-Glasses. He was the first bartender they hired, and they said he’d be there until they shuttered the place. His glasses were often crooked, and at odds with the crookedness of his bow tie. He met his wife at the bar ten years earlier and she still came in and sat in the very same seat on Fridays. I heard he had three kids, but I couldn’t really comprehend it, he seemed half child himself. He had an unpretentiousness and a Long Island accent that had been drawing people to the bar for decades. “You want me to sit like a regular person?” “Like a regular old person. What do you want to drink?” “Um.” I wanted to ask how much a beer cost, I had no idea. “It’s your shift drink. A little thank-you from the Owner at the end of the night.” He shook the amber, watery remains from a cocktail shaker into his glass. “Or a big thank-you. What do you like?” “White wine sounds all right.” I climbed onto a stool. Earlier in the night, midrush, Nicky had asked me if I had any common sense. I thought about it all night. I had no idea what to say to him, especially now that I was stripeless, except, Yes. I think I do have common sense. “Yeah? Nothing particular?” “I’m easy.” “That’s what I like to hear from my backwaiters.” I blushed. “Boxler?” he asked, and poured me a taste. I lifted it to my nose and nodded. I was too nervous to actually smell it. He poured me a glass, and I watched as he left his hand there, the wine surging past the pour line we used for guests. The glass now seemed a goblet. “You did better tonight,” said a voice behind me. Will jumped up onto the bar stool next to me. “Thank you.” I sipped my wine before I could undo the compliment. The Albert Boxler Riesling, not from Germany, but from Alsace, one of the high-end pours at twenty-six dollars a glass. And I was drinking it. Nicky had served it to me. To thank me. I rolled it through my mouth the way Simone had taught me, pursing my lips and cupping my tongue and almost making an inward whistle. I thought it would be sweet. I thought I tasted honey, or something like peaches. But then it was so dry it felt like someone had pierced me. My mouth watered and I sipped again. “It’s not sweet,” I said out loud to Nicky and Will. They laughed. “This is nice,” I said. An hour ago these were incredibly privileged seats, occupied by the kind of people who spent thirty dollars on an ounce of Calvados. Will had changed his tone with me since my burn. He was careful, or perhaps protective. I thought maybe he wanted to be my friend. He wouldn’t make a terrible first friend. He wore a khaki shirt, reminiscent of safaris. He had a long arrowhead nose and bovine brown eyes. He spoke rapidly, nearly slurring. Those first trails I thought it was because he was in a hurry. Now I saw that he didn’t want to show his teeth. They were square and yellowed, and the front left one was cracked.</p>
<h2 id="He-Pulled-Out-A-Cigarette-“Are-We-All-Clear-”"><a href="#He-Pulled-Out-A-Cigarette-“Are-We-All-Clear-”" class="headerlink" title="He Pulled Out A Cigarette. “Are We All Clear?”"></a>He Pulled Out A Cigarette. “Are We All Clear?”</h2><p>“Yes, sir.” Nicky slid him a bread-and-butter plate. I panicked when Will lit up - I barely had memories of a time when you could smoke inside restaurants. He asked if I wanted one. I shook my head. I glued my eyes to the back bar, pretending to be absorbed in the memorization of the Cognac bottles. The two of them traded incomprehensible insults about two baseball teams from the same place. “You say hi to Jonny tonight?” Nicky polished glasses from a neverending pile on the bar. They were stationed like soldiers that progressed to the front only to be replaced by more in the back. “He was here? I missed him.” “He was next to Sid and Lisa.” “Christ, those two. I stayed as far away as possible. Remember that Venice-is-an-island argument?” “I thought he was going to hit her that night.” “If I was married to that, I’d do worse than hit her.” I kept an impassive face. They must be talking about their friends. “What are you drinking, Billy Bob?” “Can I get a hit of Fernet while I think about it?” “This. Is. It,” said Ariel, slamming the glass racks down on the corner of the bar. The glasses jangled like bells and her hair flew up. “You’ve got your hair down already?” Nicky asked. His voice was harsh but his eyes playful. “Come on, Nick, please, I’m done, you know I’m done. Don’t I look done?” She ran her fingers through her long hair, scratching at the scalp like she was trying to undo a wig. She flipped her hair to one side and leaned over the bar, feet coming off the ground. “Come on Nick, snip, snip.” She made a scissors motion with her fingers. Ariel looked like trouble with her hair down. She had gone from quirky to something from the underworld, her hair well past her breasts, kinky from being knotted up all night. Her bangs were flat on her forehead and slashes of liquid eyeliner that once had swung rebelliously away from her lids were now smudged and battered. During services Ariel worked with the energy of a bird, through a series of chirps, clicking noises, phrases half sung. She became frantic easily and recovered just as easily, whistling. “Okay, you’re cut, Ari. But I do need two bottles of Rittenhouse and one bottle of Fernet.”<br>“ ‘Kay, I’ll bring the rye but homeboy here can get his own Fernet.”<br>She eyed Will’s glass, which had a black liquor in it, reeking of oversteeped tea and bubble gum. “You drink it, you stock it.” “Fuck off, Ari.” Will exhaled smoke toward her. “Fuck you, darling.” She flounced away. Will shot back his drink. “What’s that?” I asked. “Medicine.” He burped. “It’s for the end of a meal. Incredible… curative properties for the digestive tract.” He reached over the bar and started to fill a water glass with beer. Nicky stopped working and watched. “I just fucking cleaned that, Will, if you spill one fucking drop…” The beer shook in Will’s hand, and the head rose an inch out of the glass. A hush. It kept rising but didn’t spill. “I’m a pro,” Will said. “Misery,” said Ariel. She put two bottles of rye on the bar and pulled out the stool on the other side of Will. She was in a black slip, or maybe she thought it was a dress. Her bra was neon yellow like a traffic sign saying Proceed with Caution. “Hm…what is open?” She tucked her legs under her and reached into the speed rack behind the bar. “Can you animals get off my bar? I’m trying to clean.” “Is that Gigondas still good? When did we open it?” “Two nights.” “Pushing it.” “Worth considering.” Nicky put up a glass and a black bottle with an insignia at the top and went back to his cleaning. “Self-service tonight? You poured for the new girl.” “Ariel, I’m not fucking around, you barely stocked. She doesn’t even know her head from her asshole yet and I think she could have done a better job. You’ve put me back twenty minutes.” “It looks like you picked the wrong night to be bartender, old man.” Ariel emptied the wine into her glass, smelled it, and flipped open her cell phone. If Nicky had spoken to me like that I would be flattened. But nothing happened. There wasn’t even residual tension. Nicky yelled, All clear, into the kitchen and the porters sprang from behind the doors. They ran bags down the line behind the bar, an endless caravan of black bags to the curb. They propped the door open and the hot, dark air rushed in, as sticky as fingers running over my face. Misery. I drank my Riesling. Medicine. “It’s been really hot,” I said. Nobody responded. “Summer,” I said. Droning came in from the streets, then a rustling. For a second I thought it was the claustrophobic noise of the cicadas from my childhood. Or the wind bending branches. Or the moans of cows in fields. But it was cars. I wasn’t used to it yet - the elimination of nature, the brimming whine of overheating machinery. I shifted a little toward Will, wanting to seem open in case anyone talked to me. Will and Ariel were on their phones and Nicky was cursing to himself behind the bar. I thought about taking my phone out. It was new. I had left my old one on my dresser back home. I wondered what my father had done with it, with the boxes of books. Though I was also fairly certain he hadn’t opened the door to my room. When I got my new phone, the area code felt like a badge: 917. I dutifully copied everyone’s contact information into it. But I didn’t have missed calls or messages. No one even asked me to cover shifts yet. “I don’t have an air conditioner,” I said. “Really?” Will shut his phone and turned to me. “Seriously?” “They’re expensive.” “Misery,” Ariel interjected. She leaned around Will and looked at me inquisitively. “What do you do?” “Oh, I have big windows and a fan. When it’s really bad, like that stretch last week, I take cold showers to get the sweat—“<br>“No,” she said. Her eyes said, You fucking idiot. “What do you do?</p>
<p>In the city. Are you trying to be something?”<br>“Yes,” I said. “I’m <em>trying</em> to be a backwaiter.”<br>She laughed. I made Ariel laugh. “Yeah, after that the sky’s the limit.”</p>
<h2 id="“What-Do-You-Do-”"><a href="#“What-Do-You-Do-”" class="headerlink" title="“What Do You Do?”"></a>“What Do You Do?”</h2><p>“I do everything. I sing. I write music. I have a band. Willy here is trying to make a film. A claymation version of <em>À Bout de Souffle.</em>“<br>“Okay, that was one idea, it’s not the worst idea.” “No, it’s very admirable, a week of sculpting clay to get the right look of boredom—“ “Ariel, I can’t be offended that you don’t understand anything about art. I blame first, your gender, second, the system—“ “Honestly though, Will, tell us the truth. You’re just masturbating, right? In that little dark room with your clay Jean Seberg?” Will sighed. “I will admit, it’s hard not to.” He turned to me. “I actually am working on something else. I’m writing a feature—“ “The comic-book one? The hero’s journey? The exploration and reaffirmation of the patriarchal narrative?” “Ariel, do you ever shut the fuck up?” She smiled and rested a hand on his shoulder. She picked up her glass of wine and was about to sip when she said, “Oops,” and turned to us. “Cheers,” she said gravely. “Cheers.” “No, in the eyes, new girl.” “Look her in the eyes,” Will said, “or she’ll put a hex on your family.” I looked in her blackened eyes and said cheers like it was an incantation. Our three glasses touched and I pulled a mouthful of wine. The joints in my spine softened, like butter going to room temperature.</p>
<h2 id="Then-Three-Things-Happened-Seemingly-At-Once"><a href="#Then-Three-Things-Happened-Seemingly-At-Once" class="headerlink" title="- Then Three Things Happened, Seemingly At Once."></a>- Then Three Things Happened, Seemingly At Once.</h2><p>First, the music changed. Lou Reed came over the speakers like a mumbling, beloved poet-uncle. “You know I saw him once at the Gramercy Park Hotel - have you seen what they fucking did over there? That, my friends, is a rotten omen if ever there was one. So anyway, I’m sitting there and it’s like, Lou-fucking-Reed, and I’m thinking, Thank you for teaching me how to be human, you know?” I tried to keep listening. I nodded when Ariel looked at me. But the song was as intimate as a faucet dripping in the night. Next, the bar stools filled. The cooks, the closing servers, the dishwashers, all out of their uniforms now, commandeered them. Everyone looked sloppy and criminal without their stripes. To see the scarred hands of the cooks against rumpled polos or old heavymetal T-shirts, you wondered what it would be like to see one of them on a subway, without knowing they had a secret authoritative</p>
<h2 id="Life-In-Whites"><a href="#Life-In-Whites" class="headerlink" title="Life In Whites."></a>Life In Whites.</h2><p>Simone walked down the line, her hair untied. I tried to catch her eye but she went to the far end of the bar with Heather, and who I now understood to be Heather’s boyfriend, Parker, the man who’d initiated me on the coffee machine. Simone didn’t look like a statue of herself anymore. She wore plain leather sandals and she swung one off her foot once she crossed her legs. And finally, Chef banged out of the kitchen with a baseball cap and a backpack on. All his rage had melted away, leaving a man who looked like a dad on his way to a minivan. Everyone said, Good night, Chef, in a forceful singsong. He waved without looking. He barreled through and exited the building.</p>
<p>A CURTAIN CAME DOWN as Nicky reappeared behind the bar in a white undershirt and turned the lights up. The restaurant where I worked turned into a social club after hours. The bartenders weren’t performing bartender anymore. They were mixing drinks with playful proportions. The cooks weren’t looking over their shoulders for Chef, or walking numbly into hot pan handles. They were rolling joints, giggling, punching each other. The servers were stretching their arms and shoulders, comparing knots in their necks, stirring drinks with a finger, while complaining in one long, loving torrent about Howard, Zoe, dissecting the guests with a tone of passive contempt. I started to be able to tell when they were talking about regulars, because they would all want to outdo each other, demonstrating that they were the favorite. Too dazzled to contribute, I watched them. It was the duality of everyone that floored me. Simone with her simple softness, her tired eyes. Will and Ariel snipping at each other. The talking got louder as the drinks receded. I kept looking at the open door, thinking a stranger would walk in and want a drink, or that the Owner would decide to pass down Sixteenth Street on his way home from an event and catch us and call the police. I’m new, I’m blameless, I would say with hands up. No one else seemed concerned. It made me wonder who really owned the restaurant. “Black Bear?” Scott yelled down the bar to Ariel. “No, Park Bar. Sasha just texted, he has a corner.” “No más Park Bar,” he said. Jared and Jeff, two of his line cooks, started laughing. “No you did not fuck the new one - Vivian?” “Vivian!” they shouted. They raised their glasses. “Full of shit,” Ariel yelled. She turned to me and said, “Fuck. I thought she was gay.” “Too slow, Ari,” said Will. “Oh we’ll see about that.” She put her hand on top of mine and said into my eyes, “They always start off straight. That’s part of the fun.” I laughed. Petrified. “What time is it?” I asked. A wall of exhaustion hit me with the drinks. It seemed to be a good moment to excuse myself. I didn’t know who was going to clean this all up so the restaurant would be blank and sterile for the morning. When I looked down the line I saw Simone. She was texting and I thought, It’s too late for her to be texting. That was when I first realized she was older. An image of him hit me in the back of my throat, just from habit. Who did Jake turn into when they turned the lights up? The shift drink - the first liminal space between work and my apartment, a space that I could project onto for hours, a space of inevitability where I would catch up with him eventually. “It isn’t two yet,” Ariel said. As if something switched at two. “Do you do this every night?” “Do what?” I nodded toward my glass of Boxler that refilled itself every time my eyes were averted. To the half-empty wine bottles that lined the bar for consumption. To Nicky eating cocktail olives while he and Scott told each other to fuck their mothers. To Lou’s gravelly serenade coasting down on us through a film of smoke. To the row of us, unkempt, glassy and damp, sweating drinks in our hands. “This?” Ariel waved away the smoke in front of my face, waved it away like it was nothing. “We’re just having our shift drink.” WHEN I STARTED they told me, You have no experience. New York experience is all that counts. Well, I had a little now. A structure presented itself to me, like the grid of the city. There was the GM, there were managers. There were senior servers, servers, backwaiters. The backwaiters originally functioned as a holding pen where aspiring servers awaited transcendence, but there was so little internal movement, most of them seemed contented where they were. I had Heather to thank for my position - she had talked a reluctant Parker into serving after six years of backwaiting. That’s the only reason I existed. The backwaiter had three kinds of shifts: food running (the carrying of plates), dining room backwaiter (the busing and resetting of tables), and beverage running (assisting with the drinks), which included a fair amount of barista work. I noticed that even though we rotated the shifts, people showed an affinity for one area and developed a schedule around it. Will was an excellent food runner, with his Yes-Chef-No-Chef military mentality, his eyes-to-ground focus. So while he was a backwaiter, he also had some loyalties in the kitchen, which he exhibited in several annoying ways, such as partaking in kitchen beer, and complaining about “FOH” as if he weren’t one of the front of house. Ariel loved the freedom of being dining room backwaiter. She waltzed around, picking up a few plates, topping off a few waters, polishing a few knives and nudging them into place on the newly set table with first a look of pinched frustration, and then placidity when it came together. And while this wasn’t true of all backwaiters, Ariel was generally trusted to talk to the guests. If the rest of us so much as said “Hello” to a table, a scolding was sure to follow. Sasha was too good at his job to stay still. He got bored easily. If you put him in the kitchen, he could run your plates, drop off ice at the bar, and bus two tables on his way back in - all in the same amount of time it took me to find position 3 at table 31. It worked against him - I saw Ariel, Will, even the servers slack when they were on with him. Which left me. For several reasons I gravitated toward the bar.</p>
<p>First, because I noticed that there was a spot open to be the beverage runner. Second, because I had an aptitude for beverage running, cultivated over many years making hearts in mediocre lattes. The third reason was that it was a chance to get away from Chef in the kitchen. The fourth, or first, or only reason was that Jake was a bartender. I assisted the servers in delivering their drinks to tables. I assisted the bartenders in keeping their bar stocked. I brought up crates of wine and beer, buckets of ice, ran the glass racks, the bar bus tubs, polished the glasses. If you were slow, the drinks were slow, and if the drinks were slow, the turn times lagged and we made less money. And then, about an hour and a half into each turn, the first espresso ticket would print. And then I was under it for the next thirty minutes. At the end of the night the bartender made a stocking list and I put the whole thing back together again. Some people dreaded beverage running because it was a pure shit show for most of the night - you got hit with the drinks on the initial rush and the coffee on the tail end. Yes, my neck, my hands, my legs hurt. I loved it. There was only one problem with my new position. The manual labor, the coffee - fine, that was the forty-nine percent of it. The fifty-one percent of beverage running was wine knowledge.</p>
<p>“APPETITE IS NOT a symptom,” Simone said when I complained of being hungry. “It cannot be cured. It’s a state of being, and like most, has its attendant moral consequences.” THE FIRST OYSTER WAS a cold lozenge to push past, to push down, to take behind the taste buds in the back hollow of the throat. Nobody had to tell me this - I was the oyster virgin, my fear told me what to do when the small wet stone came into my mouth. “Wellfleet,” someone said. “No, too small.” “PEI.” “Yeah, some cream.” “But so briny.” Briny. PEI. A code. I took a second oyster in my hand, inspected it. The shell was sharp, sculptural, a container naturally molded to its contents, like skin. The oyster flinched. I suspended it on my tongue this time. Briny means salty. It means made by the ocean, it means breathing seawater. Metallic, musky, kelp. My mouth like a fishing wharf. Jake was on his third, flipping the shells over onto the ice. Swallow, now. “I’m going West Coast, it’s too creamy,” someone said. “But clean.” “Kumamotos. Washington, right?” he said. “He’s right,” said Zoe, smiling like a fool for him. I wrote it down. I heard him say, “Do you like them?” I was sure he was talking to me but I pretended to be confused. Me? Do I like them? I had no idea. I took gulps of water. The taste stayed. In the locker room I brushed my teeth twice, stuck my tongue out to the mirror, wondering when the residue would go away. THAT SUNDAY AFTERNOON I was positive Mrs. Neely was dead, that she had died at table 13. I stayed away but kept her in my vision until another server went and revived her. She asked for more sherry for her soup. A shot glass for her soup, a glassful for herself. She was nearing ninety, born and still living in Harlem. She took the bus down to Union Square every Sunday in stockings, high heels, and a hat. She had a burgundy pillbox with silk flowers, and a cornflower-blue fascinator edged in lace. She had been a Rockette at Radio City Music Hall. “That’s why I still have these legs,” she said, pulling her skirt up to her thighs. “I dined at Le Pavillon. Henri Soulé, that bastard, he ran the door like a dictator. But I went, everyone went. Even the Kennedys went. Child, you don’t remember. But I remember. They really cooked your food back then. Where’s the cream, I say. The butter, the green beans, honey, you didn’t even need to chew.” “I wish I could have been there,” I said. “The haute cuisine, it’s done, it’s dead. Al dente. That’s what they do now.” She paused and looked around the table. “Did my soup come?” “Um. Yes.” I had cleared it myself ten minutes ago. “Now, I haven’t had my soup yet. I need my soup.” “Mrs. Neely,” I whispered stupidly, “you already had the soup.” Suddenly Simone was beside me, sweeping away my inefficiencies, making me irrelevant. I drew back as Mrs. Neely narrowed in on Simone. “Tell the chef I’d like my soup now.” “Absolutely, Mrs. Neely. May I bring you anything else?” “Oh you look tired. I think you would do to drink a little old wine. Some good old wine, like some sherry.” Simone laughed, her cheeks colored. “I think that’s exactly what I need.”</p>
<p>PARTLY IN THE HANDBOOK, but mostly just understood: You could sleep with anyone, except those above you. You couldn’t sleep with anyone on salary. Anyone that could hire or fire you. You could sleep with anyone on your level. All the hourlies. Anything slightly more romantic than sex had to be disclosed to Howard, but the sex passed freely below the surface. I asked Heather about her and Parker. She wore a small vintage engagement ring - his grandmother’s - but they hadn’t set a date yet. “Parker? Oh, I remember my first trail, seeing him from down the bar, and I said, Oh lord, look at Trouble. We were both betrothed to other people. He was engaged to - I’m not kidding - a Debbie Sugarbaker from Jackson, Mississippi, a lawyer-something, plain as white bread. Don’t you ever tell him I told you. Once we started talking, I thought, Here we go. My real life is coming for me, gunning at me like a train.” “Wow,” I said. My life, my train. “This place is a love shack, darlin’. Try to keep your panties on.”</p>
<p>THE INTERIOR OF Park Bar was dark and the decorations minimal. But watching over us, high up near the ceiling, was a huge reproduction of a painting that felt familiar. I told them I’d seen it before but that might have been a lie. Two boxers in a ring, midconflict, midinjury. Action everywhere, blows landing, receding. Except the faces. The two boxers’ faces were blurred together, one solid mass. Will had finally asked me to join them for a post-shift-drink drink, or Shift Drink Part Two. I hung close to him while Nicky locked up the restaurant. People said their good-byes, discussed which trains were running, flagged down cabs. I remembered Ariel’s voice daring me—“It isn’t two yet”—and I checked my phone: 2:15 a.m. They headed into the parking garage across the street from us. Oh do you have a car? I asked. Will said, No, we’re going to Park Bar. Ariel hummed into the echo. We walked farther underground. Rubber soles on cement, oil stains, gasoline fumes. The guard waved to Will. We ascended and we were on Fifteenth Street under a huge litup sign that said PARK. And there was, indeed, a bar. No one asked me if I did coke. Ariel asked me if I wanted a treat and I said sure. <em>I had done it</em> seemed to be the same as <em>I do it.</em> I<br>caught the subtext that everyone did a little bit of coke and nobody had a problem. If I had any inclination to think about it the noise in Park Bar ran right over it. It was crowded and Will and Ariel knew everyone. Scott and the cooks held up a table in the corner. I recognized some of the prep guys. We moved toward the table and I set my purse by them just like Ariel. I saw people that had been cut earlier, people who worked the a.m. Ariel pointed to different tables and said, “Blue Water, Gotham, Gramercy, some retards from Babbo, and so on.” I nodded. Will held on to my elbow as we made our way to the bar, where Sasha sat next to a Dominican man with huge diamond stud earrings. “Oh look who finally graced us from her present!” Sasha said, and shocked me by kissing me on both cheeks. The other man introduced himself as “Carlos-at-your-service.” He was a busboy at Blue Water Grill and he sold drugs to every server within a tenblock radius. The line for the bathroom ran in humid pairs, some ear-piercingly loud, some whispering as they waited. It wound around the room. After two sips of my beer, Ariel took my hand and we joined the line. When our turn came, we shut a flimsy door, hooked it, and locked the handle. She dipped a key into a small plastic bag and handed it to me. Someone banged on the door. “Wait your fucking turn motherfucker!” she screamed. She dug the key around and took a bump herself. “What do you think of Vivian?” “The one Scott was talking about?” “Don’t listen to him. He’s lying, they’re all fucking homophobes.” “She’s pretty,” I said. “She has great tits? I don’t know. I don’t feel anything. Can I have some more?” Ariel handed me the bag and I<br>pyramided up the powder. “Are you gay gay or just half gay?”<br>“Jesus, you’re something. Where do you come from? Okay, stick this in your mouth.” She stuck the key in my mouth like a pacifier. It tasted like battery acid and salt. “You good babe? How do I look? Torrid? Like a natural disaster?” She ruffled her hair up like she’d been in an electrical storm. I nodded. She kissed me on the forehead, and where she kissed tightened, first in my skin, then in my skull, then in my brain. A saccharine, sentimental drip ran down my throat, and I was blinded by how stupid I had been not to see that everything was absolutely, one hundred percent going to be okay.</p>
<p>The boxers panted furiously above my head, I could hear them: let me go, let me go. They put on <em>Abbey Road</em> and I wanted to tell everyone at the bar about how for my sixth birthday I knew I wouldn’t have a party because my father didn’t believe in birthdays but I stole two pastel Hallmark invitations from the grocery store by slipping them into the back of my jeans and I used all my colored pencils to decorate them and addressed one to John Lennon and one to my mother, asking them to please come to my house for tea on my birthday, and the night before my birthday I put them in the empty planter next to the front door and I went inside and I prayed on my knees next to my bed and I begged God to come and deliver the invitations to John Lennon and my mother, I promised him I would never cry again, I would always finish my dinner, and I wouldn’t even ask for another birthday for the rest of my life, and I went to bed holding an unendurable, trembling joy in my arms, thanking God for his hard work tracking the two of them down, thanking him for knowing how badly I needed them, and when I woke in the morning and the cards were in the planter, wet and mushy, I threw them away and I didn’t cry in front of my father, but later in school I started crying at my desk and couldn’t stop and they sent me to the nurse and I told her I knew that God didn’t exist and they called my father to come pick me up, and I heard the nurse arguing with him and then she said to him, exasperated, “Do you know that today is her birthday?” Instead I said, my voice coming out of me with brusque clarity: “On certain days, I forget why I came here.” They nodded empathetically. “Do I need to <em>justify</em> myself all the time? Justify myself for being alive and wanting more?” They introduced me to Terry, who bartered free drinks for free bumps. He was pushing forty, his hair balding from the top down so it was still long on the bottom, and he tucked it obsessively behind his ears. He raged like a bull in a pen back there, flirting, singing, snapping at the bar back. When I was introduced he pointed to his cheek so I kissed him and he gave me a beer. He said, “On this day in 1864, General Grant surveyed General Lee’s army and knew he was sending his men to their deaths. He told his soldiers, There will be no surrender, gentlemen. And we think we have it rough.” I thought, Is that even true? But instead I said, “At least they had something to fight for.” He shrugged. “I may have made some bad life choices. Who can tell?” A dagger of morning prowled outside the open windows. The air revived itself, my bones braced like something new was coming. We reentered the line for the bathroom, passing the bag between our back pockets, our hands lingering longer, a feeling of clouds, ominous, pads of melancholy on our fingertips, impending headaches….Mundane, yes, but thrilling to me, all of it.</p>
<p>“ALL RIGHT. What is Sancerre?” Simone’s brown eyes, serpentine. “Sauvignon Blanc,” I answered, my hands crossed in front of me on the table.</p>
<p>“What is <em>Sancerre</em>?”<br>“Sancerre…” I shut my eyes. “Look at France,” she whispered. “Wine starts with the map.” “It’s an appellation in the Loire Valley. They are famous for Sauvignon Blanc.” “More. Put the pieces together. What is it?” “It’s misunderstood.”</p>
<h2 id="“Why-”-1"><a href="#“Why-”-1" class="headerlink" title="“Why?”"></a>“Why?”</h2><p>“Because people think Sauvignon Blanc is fruity.” “It is not fruity?” “No, it is. It’s fruity, right? But it’s also not? And people think you can grow it anywhere, but you can’t. Popularity is a mixed blessing?”</p>
<h2 id="“Continue-”"><a href="#“Continue-”" class="headerlink" title="“Continue.”"></a>“Continue.”</h2><p>“The Loire is at the top. It’s colder.” She nodded and I continued. “And Sauvignon Blanc likes that it’s cold.” “Colder climates mean a longer growing season. When the grape takes a longer time to ripen.” “It is more delicate. And has more minerality. It’s like Sancerre is the grape’s true home?” I waited for affirmation or correction. I did not know half of what I’d said. I think she pitied me, but I received a grim smile and, finally, a half glass of Sancerre.</p>
<p>AFTER SERVICE the dishwashers rolled up the sticky bar mats and the smell of rot rose from the blackened grout in the tiles. The kitchen was a hollow amphitheater of stainless steel, still, but holding the aftereffects of the fires and banging and shouting. The kitchen boys were scrubbing every surface, rubbing out the night. Two servers sat on the lowboy, eating pickled red onions from a metal tin. Leftover ice cream sat on the bread station, turning to soup. “Hey, new girl, I’m in here.” Me? Jake was in the doorway of a walk-in. He had a cup full of lemon wedges in his hand. His apron was streaked with wine, his shirtsleeves were rolled high and I could see his veins. “Are you allowed to be in there?” What I meant is, Do you ever think about me the way I think about you? “Did you like them? The oysters?”<br>When he said the word <em>oysters,</em> their flavor flamed on my tongue, as if it had been lying dormant. “Yes. I think I do.” “Come in here.” His tattoos showed themselves as he pressed the door open wider. I passed under his arm, looking back to make sure Simone wasn’t watching. I had never been in any space alone with him. “Are we going to get locked in?” What I meant is, I’m scared. Inside there were two open beers, the Schneider Weisse Aventinus, a bottle I’d pulled for the bar but never tasted. The beers were propped against a cardboard box labeled Greens but filled with littleneck clams. We were in the seafood closet. Crimson tuna fillets, marbled salmon sides, snowy cod. The air nipped at my skin, smelling like the barest trace of the sea. “What’s that tattoo?” I asked, pointing to his biceps. He pulled his sleeve down. Jake dug through a wooden crate labeled with masking tape, Kumamotos. He pulled out two tiny rocks, discarded the debris that clung to the outside. A strand of seaweed stuck to his pants. “They look so filthy,” I whispered. “They’re a secret. Quite a leap of faith.” His voice was quiet with the motor of the fridge, and I involuntarily shivered and moved toward him. He pulled a blunt knife out of his pocket and wedged the tip into an invisible crack. Two switches of his wrist and it was open. “Where did you learn to do that?” He pinched a lemon over it and said, “Take it quickly.” I flipped the shell back. I was prepared for the brininess. For the softness of it. For the rigidity and strangeness of the ritual. Adrenalized, fiercely private. I panted slightly and opened my eyes. Jake was looking at me and said, “They’re perfect.” He handed me the beer. It was nearly black, persuasive as chocolate, weighty. The finish was cream, it matched the oyster’s creaminess. The sensory conspiracy made the blood rush to my head, made my skin break out in goose bumps. Ignore him. Look away. I looked at him. “Can I have another?”</p>
<p>IN BED I could feel the pain in my back diffusing into the mattress. I touched my neck, my shoulder, my biceps. I could feel where my body had changed. I clicked on my cell phone: 4:47 a.m. The black air wouldn’t move, it wouldn’t shift in or out the window. The heat was an adhesive - even the fan couldn’t disrupt it. I went to the bathroom and saw my shirtless roommate passed out on the couch. His chest was slick with sweat and he was snoring. He had an air conditioner blasting away in his room. Some people were morons. The bathroom was a narrow room of tiny brown tiles, brown grout and brown, moldy ceiling corners. I turned the shower on to cold and stepped in and out of it, gasping and sighing, until my skin was stiff. I put my towel on top of my sheets and lay down sopping wet. The heat landed again like tiny gnats on my skin. I touched my abdomen, my thighs. I was getting stronger. I touched myself and I felt like stone. I saw Jake in the locker room dropping his pants, his tattered boxers, his pale legs. I thought about the sweat on his arms, of how violently he shook the cocktail shaker, of the sweat adhering his white T-shirt to him the day I first saw him. And when I tried to picture his face it was blank. It had no features except eyes. It didn’t matter. I came abruptly and gratefully. My body shone in the distressed streetlight. I was used to being alone. But I’d never been aware of so many other people, also alone. I knew that all over the south side of Williamsburg people were staring at their ceilings, praying for a breeze to come and cure them, and like that I lost myself. I evaporated.</p>
<h2 id="Vi-You-Burned-Yourself-You-Burned-Yourself-By-Participating"><a href="#Vi-You-Burned-Yourself-You-Burned-Yourself-By-Participating" class="headerlink" title="Vi You Burned Yourself. You Burned Yourself By Participating."></a>Vi You Burned Yourself. You Burned Yourself By Participating.</h2><p>On the wineglasses that came out in gushes of steam, on the espresso machine’s milk-scum-covered steamer wand, on the leaky hot-water faucet of the bar sink, on the china plates searing themselves in the heat lamps at the pass. On the webbings of hands, on your fingertips, on your wrists, your inner elbows, strangely right above your outer elbow. You were restocking printer tape and had to move behind Chef, but caught your skin on the handle of a copper saucepan. You yelled, it spun and fell to the floor. Chef sent you out of the kitchen and you reset tables for the rest of lunch. The burns healed and your skin was boiled. Knicks in your knuckles from tearing the foil unprofessionally from wine bottles. Scott said, “The skin gets so tough, even a knife won’t scratch it.” He grabbed a plate out of the salamander with his hands to really illustrate the point.</p>
<p>BY THE TIME we waddled up to the bar it was well past midnight and we were as tattered as the dining room floor. It had been a hard one. The dishwasher broke in the middle of service and two of us were pulled to hand wash the glasses in scalding water. Then the air conditioners, usually mediocre at best, bottomed out. The technicians arrived as we sat down for our shift drinks. They propped open the door and we all looked wistfully at the street. No change in temperature arrived.</p>
<p>Nicky let the backwaiters have gin and tonics as rewards. My fingers were thoroughly poached, the muscle between my thumb and index finger throbbing from polishing. I didn’t even have the energy to contemplate sitting next to Jake and Simone. I took my stool next to Will wearily. An empty bottle of Hendrick’s stood on the bar like a mascot. Walter sat on the other side of me. We had never overlapped. He was a large, elegant man in his fifties with a chic gap between his front teeth. He looked as tired as I felt, the lines around his eyes amplifying with each exhale. He asked how I was settling in and we made small talk. But when I told him I lived in Williamsburg, he grunted. “I lived there,” he said. “You? With all the dead-eyed slouchers?” “In the late eighties - were you born then? Six years. God it was appalling. And look at it now. The trains used to stop running. Some nights we walked the tracks.” “Ha!” Nicky slapped the bar. “I forgot about that.” “It was a straight shot, the quickest way.” Walter finished his drink and pushed it toward Nicky. “Can I get a scooch for this story?” “We had the whole building,” Walter said as Nicky emptied out a bottle of Montepulciano into his glass. “Three floors. My share was $550, which was not a little bit of money. I was with Walden… Walden and Walter of Williamsburg. We thought that was cute. Walden needed space for his paintings, they - well.” He looked at me. “Even you have probably seen them. The canvas itself took up a wall. He built them indoors and we broke them down to get them back out. And then his collage phase began in earnest. One of the floors we kept as a junk shop. Car fenders, defunct lamps, chicken coop wiring, boxes of photographs.” Walter chuckled softly into his wine. “This was so long ago, before his, what do they call it?” Everyone at the bar was listening with their heads down, except Simone, who watched him patiently. “His materialist phase,” she said. “Ah, Simone remembers! If you ever forget something about your story, Simone will remember.” They looked at each other, not unkindly. “They called it his coup d’état. The beginning of his love affair with Larry Gagosian. Me-te-or-ic. And all the Williamsburg stuff, now I suppose it’s technically his juvenilia, worth millions. He dicked around with garbage and I sang opera in the bathtub.” “I miss your singing,” Simone said. “The third-floor skylight was missing. When it rained it was like the Pantheon, a column of water and light in the middle of the room. The floor rotted in this glorious black circle. It grew moss in the spring. They tried to sell it to us for $30,000. I am not kidding. We thought, Jesus, who would buy a place on Grand Street and Wythe? I assumed the river would swallow it up.” He stopped. I took a tiny sip of my gin and tonic, which was too strong for me though I would never admit it. “There are condos there now,” I said. I didn’t know what else to say. My head was getting difficult to prop up. “All these halffinished, empty buildings. They’ll never fill them. There are no people.” “You are condos, new girl,” Sasha said. Walter stared into the bottom of his glass. “Fucking holes in the ceiling. Frozen pipes all winter, showering at the Y. We tossed crackheads out of the entryway weekly—<em>weekly.</em> One of them tried to stab Walden with a steak knife—our steak knife. And sometimes I<br>wish we would have stayed.”</p>
<p>I RODE the L train, back and forth. Back and forth. In the beginning, I made eye contact with everyone. I applied mascara, I counted my cash tips on my lap, I wrote myself notes, ate bagels, redistributed the cream cheese with my fingers, moved my shoulders to music, stretched out on the seats, smiled at flashes of my reflection in the train windows. “Your self-awareness is lacking,” Simone said to me one day as I was leaving. “Without an ability to see yourself, you can’t protect yourself. Do you understand? It’s crucial to your survival that you pause the imaginary sound track in your head. Don’t isolate your senses - you’re interacting with an environment.” I learned how to sit still and look at nothing and no one. When someone next to me on the train started talking to themselves, I was embarrassed for them.</p>
<p>I WAS WORKING the dining room the first day Mrs. Neely didn’t have her wallet. I was replenishing the silver and I heard her exclaim. She threw her purse up on the table with her needle-thin arms and her knife fell to the floor. It sounded like an alarm. The surrounding tables turned. She pulled out slips of paper, crumpled Kleenex, several tubes of lipstick, her MetroCard. Simone picked up the knife and put her hand on her shoulder. Mrs. Neely sat back down but her hands continued to flap in front of her face. “Well I…well I…Well.” “You know, I believe we found it,” Simone said, catching one of Mrs. Neely’s erratic hands. “You are all set. I noticed you didn’t finish your lamb today, was it all right?” “Oh it was underdone. I don’t know what you pay that chef for if he’s not able to cook a lamb. I attended a dinner with Julia Child once, and we had lamb. James Beard, he could cook a lamb, my dear.” “Thank you for telling me. I will pass it along.” Simone picked up the check. I hadn’t seen Zoe come up next to me. Simone approached us. “There’s no wallet,” she said and sighed. “I’ll go ahead and comp it.” “I should check with Howard first,” Zoe said carefully. “Excuse me?” Simone turned to her. I backed up. “The situation is entirely out of control. It deserves a conversation. Chef is completely fed up - double orders of soup, lamb sent back three times? It’s getting worse.” Simone stiffened, I felt it from a few feet away. Zoe kept her hands clasped behind her back, enforcing composure. A silence bubbled between them and I knew Zoe would break it first. “You can’t just comp entire meals every week, Simone. That’s not your call. And it’s gone beyond the restaurant’s responsibility. Do you remember when she fell? That’s on us. Where is the line? Where is her family?” She engrossed me. She flickered.</p>
<p>“Every week, Zoe. For twenty <em>fucking</em> years. You’re looking at her family. I’m taking care of the meal.” There was now a small orbit of us around the hutch and when Simone turned we scattered. I ran into the kitchen and Ariel had wide eyes. “Shit,” she said. “Queen Bee is getting written up for that. Picking up!”</p>
<p>WHEN I WOULD finally get to taste the wine at the end of our lessons, I would say idiotic things like, Oh I get it now. Simone would shake her head. “You’re only beginning to learn what you don’t know. First you must relearn your senses. Your senses are never inaccurate - it’s your ideas that can be false.”</p>
<p>I DIDN’T KNOW what a date was and I wasn’t an anomaly. Most of the girls I knew didn’t get asked out on dates. People got together through alcohol and a process of elimination. If they had anything in common beyond that they would go out and have a conversation. When Will asked me to get a drink in the late afternoon on my day off, I thought that placed us firmly in the friend arena, like getting coffee. We met at a tiny space called Big Bar, four booths and a few stools doused in red light. When he opened the door for me and he put his hand on the small of my back I thought, Oh fucking fuck shit fuck, is this what a date is? “Kansas,” he said. I smiled. It wasn’t awful, being somewhere besides the restaurant and my room. To be talking to another human without doing fifteen other things at once. Not awful at all. “It all makes sense.” “Does it? You were getting the Midwest vibe?” “I wasn’t actually. My radar is all off - everyone seems like they were born and raised in the restaurant. But now it makes sense.” “Because of my charm?” “No, because of your manners.” “Charming manners?” “Utterly,” I said and drank my beer. It is a strange pressure to be across from a man who wants something that you don’t want to give. It’s like standing in a forceful current, which at first you think is not too strong, but the longer you stand, the more tired you become, the harder it is to stay upright. “How long have you been here?” “I came for film school like, god, five years ago? That’s depressing. I promised my mom I would move back as soon as school was over, and I feel like I’m running against the clock. She’s livid.” “Is she? It’s so impressive that you got out, that you’re doing what you want.” “She thinks family is impressive.” I swallowed. “Maybe she’s right.” “Your parents know you’re here?” “What does that mean?” “I don’t know. You give off this runaway vibe, like you’re all huddled up inside yourself.” “I’m flattered. I’m pretty sure my dad knows.” “Pretty sure? What about your mom? Her little baby girl in the big city?” “My mom doesn’t exist.” “Doesn’t exist? What does that mean?” “That means I don’t want to talk about it.” Will’s eyes became concerned and I thought, Don’t do that. That’s not why I told you. It’s not something to fix. “What happened to film school?” I asked. “You come here for one thing, you end up absorbed by another. I have all these ideas, it’s just…Well. It’s hard to retain the original vision, which is usually the most pure, you know?” “Yeah.” I didn’t. “You really came here for nothing?” “I wouldn’t say for nothing.” “What did you do in school?” “I read.” “Any particular subjects? Are you always this difficult?” I sighed. It wasn’t as intense as Howard’s interview. “I majored in Lit. And I came here to start my life.” “How’s it going? Your life?” I paused. He seemed like he really wanted to know. I thought about it. “It’s kind of fucking amazing.” He laughed. “You remind me of the girls back home.” “Oh yeah? I’m vaguely insulted.” “Don’t be. You’re not jaded.” I thought, You don’t know me, but I smiled politely. “I’ll catch up soon. Just let Chef scream at me a few more times and I will go completely numb.” “He’s got a hard job.” “Really? The only thing I see him do is yell. I’ve never even seen him cook!” “It’s different at that level. He’s not a line cook anymore, he’s running the whole fucking business. I know he misses cooking every single day.” “The other day he told me to stab my fucking tickets or he’d stab me. I mean, how is that allowed?” “He didn’t say that to you.” “He did! I cried by the ice machines.” “You’re a little sensitive.” “He’s a monster.” Will put his hands up, surrendering, smiling. I liked him. The truth was that he reminded me of people back home too - nice, openbook people. Thinking of Chef reminded me of the restaurant and that I could talk freely because I wasn’t in it. “You know, Simone is kind of helping me with wine.” “Ugh.” He scrunched up his face. “I would be careful with Simone’s help.” “Why? She’s so smart. She’s so fucking good at her job. You ask her questions all the time.” “Yeah, when I’m desperate. Owing Simone a favor is like being owned by the mafia. Her help is a double-edged sword.” “Are you being serious right now?” “I would just be careful what you tell her. She and Howard have this weird thing where she reports on all the servers. Everyone thinks they’re fucking. Once Ariel told Simone something about Sasha and then Sasha got written up. And she has these creepy relationships with Howard’s girls, and then they disappear in the middle of the night. I don’t know, she’s fine, but she’s been there too long, she gets bored, makes trouble.” “I don’t believe that. I get the feeling that she’s genuinely interested in helping me.” It’s not that I expected Will to get her. She probably barely tolerated him. But the rest of it disoriented me. “What are Howard’s girls? What do you mean they disappear?” “Never mind, doll,” he said. He finished his beer, and I knew I had to decide if we were staying for another round. It felt like a mistake to get drunk before four p.m., but it would be worth it if I could get him to keep talking. “Maybe you softened her up,” he said and his eyes went past me. “Speak of the devil. I forgot this was her neighborhood.” I turned and there she was, in a black shift dress, looking so petite I would have looked right past her. I flipped back into the booth, chafing. This wasn’t Park Bar; this was my day off. I wanted Simone to think I was nude modeling for painters or drinking absinthe with musicians, or at the Guggenheim, where she’d told me to go, or even that I was alone at a bar with a book being sophisticated. How could I have been stupid enough to be drinking with Will? “Do you think she heard us?” I whispered. “We should go.” “What? You were just saying—“ “I’m sick,” I said. “I mean, I don’t feel well. This beer isn’t sitting well. I have to go home.”</p>
<h2 id="“Are-You-Okay-”"><a href="#“Are-You-Okay-”" class="headerlink" title="“Are You Okay?”"></a>“Are You Okay?”</h2><p>“Will, I’m sorry, we can do this again, but I—“ I could feel her eyes on us, there was no way to miss us in the four hundred square feet. I took a breath and felt a hand on my shoulder. “Aren’t you two a lovely pair.” She held a paperback book with a French title in her hand and smelled like gardenias. I wished Will would die. “We’re not. We were just talking about work stuff,” I said. “Sorry, hi Simone. I like that dress. Lovely to see you too.” “So you’re off today, huh?” Will said, a little coolly, I thought. “Yes, I’m just meeting a friend. And I think Jake will be by later.” I finished my beer. “I—“ “I finally got her outside of work,” Will said, showing me off. “Oh, is she so elusive?” Simone said with a derisive smile. “I’m not.” I stood up. “I’m just, upset, I have an upset stomach, I mean.” I pulled up my purse and put five dollars on the table. “Will, I’m sorry, next time.” I did not look back. Once I hit Second Avenue, I threw my arm up. I understood why taxis were so essential to life in the city, even with those of us who couldn’t afford them. Desperation.</p>
<p>AS I STARTED up the stairs to find more straws, Jake was coming down. He brushed the back of his hand against my hand. I stared at it, but my hand looked the same. There had been an explosion, but no collapse. I spent the next five hours sleepwalking, wondering whether he had touched me with intention. EVERYTHING WAS over my head. The senior servers, the bartenders especially, had doctorates in talking shit to guests. They could skim any topic. You couldn’t stump them. The briefness of these interactions meant their casual expertise was never exposed as groundless. As I overheard it, to be good at this job you needed to know the city, but also how to leave the city. Which was hard for me to imagine, since I found the idea of traveling to the Upper West Side daunting. Everyone had a cursory knowledge of the East Coast weekend retreats: not just upstate and Connecticut, but unlisted antiques stores in the Hudson Valley, small towns in the Berkshires, lakes in the Northeast Kingdom. Beaches were their own category, divided mainly between the Hamptons and the Cape, and again, the specific towns were identity badges. You knew which shows were at which galleries, and it was a given that you attended the museums regularly. When asked whether you had seen Manet’s execution paintings (and you were going to be asked by someone taking a late lunch after visiting MoMA), you were either on your way or had already seen them in Paris. You had opinions about opera. If you didn’t, you politely implied it was too bourgeois. You knew what was playing at Film Forum, and you corrected anyone who lumped Godard and Truffaut together. You knew trivia from the guests’ lives: where couples got married, where men traveled for business, what kinds of projects they were working on and the deadlines. You knew where they’d gone for undergrad and what they’d dreamed of doing while they were there. You knew names of the towns where they kept their mothers in Florida. You asked about the absent colleague/husband/wife. You knew the players on the Yankees and Mets, you knew the weather, more about predicting the weather than any meteorologist. You were a compendium of disposable information that people burned up while they drank and escaped their lives. And the most peculiar part was how none of it mattered to them. One push through the kitchen doors and they were back to food, sex, drinking, drugs, what bar had opened, what band was playing where, and who had been drunkest the night before. Once I saw someone throw a rag in Scott’s face over a spaghetti carbonara dispute, but I don’t know if anyone held a political belief. They were so well versed in that upper-middle-class culture - no, in the <em>tastes</em> of upper-middle-class culture - they could all pass.</p>
<p>Even most of the cooks had gotten an Ivy League education at Cornell before they spent a second fortune at CIA. They were fluent in rich people. <em>That</em> was the fifty-one percent of it.</p>
<ul>
<li>SCOTT AND HIS COOKS sat on a lowboy postshift, drinking beer. Scott was bitching about Chef: how threatened Chef was by his food, how out of touch Chef was with what was happening in Spain, how Chef had dried up a decade ago. Chef called Scott’s food “subversive” and it was clear that Scott wanted us to see that as a compliment. Jeff and Jared nodded, worshipping. As I eavesdropped I felt an unexpected swing of loyalty toward Chef, toward his food and the restaurant he’d built, even if was “hopelessly out of date.” The back of house had separate kitchen beer, which sat all night in an iced-down bus tub. One of the interns drained and refilled the ice during service - that task was actually in his job description, I asked him. The beer was genius. The boys could be cut, burned, or crying, but within their line of vision was a bucket of beer that was just theirs. “New girl, come here, Santos likes you.” They had the newest prep guy that I hadn’t met yet. His skin was stretched and skinny, like a child in a growth spurt’s. He didn’t look much past fifteen. “Be nice, guys,” I said. I jumped up on the lowboy. Jared put his arm around Santos and said, “I love Santos. He’s our new friend. Show the new girl that dance we taught you. The dance like a pollo.” Santos smiled but looked at the floor and didn’t move. “Ah he’s being shy now. Want a beer?” Santos took one and they gave one to me as well. I swung my heels against the door. I saw Santos slipping under a fence at the border. Making himself as thin as a coin and rolling through a crack in the wall. They had told me it was so expensive they could only pick one to go. And that once that one landed, it was too dangerous to ever go back. “Cuántos años tiene?” I asked. “Dieciocho,” he said defensively. “No es verdad? Eres un niño. De dónde eres?” “Mexico,” said Scott. He finished his beer in three gulps and opened another. “You know I’m not hiring any more filthy Dominicans. Right, Papi?” Papi was the troll-like man who had spit at me the first day. He nodded with hooded eyes and a vacant smile. Santos said timidly, “Hablas español?” “Sólo un poco. Puedo entender mejor que hablar. Hablas inglés?” He looked at the kitchen boys to see their reaction. “Not impressive,” said Scott. “Everyone speaks Spanish here. Bueno, yes?” They opened new beers and Jared said, “Papi, do the pollo dance.” Papi knocked out his elbows and flapped them like a chicken and yodeled. He spun in a circle and the boys clapped. “One more time, Papi, show Santos how the pros do it.” Scott saw that I wasn’t laughing and seemed embarrassed. His eyes said, These are the rules here. “He’s wasted. They steal bottles of whiskey and hide them in the dry goods.” “Oh,” I said. We drank our beers. Until that moment I’d been the girl they tricked into dancing like a pollo. Santos looked at me with grasping, runny eyes, the kind of eyes that take in everything and have no defenses. I knew how badly he needed a friend. I shook my head and asked for another beer. I looked at Santos appraisingly and said to the boys, “He’s brand-new, isn’t he?”</li>
